# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

Prompted by rising deployments of VRE, policy-makers are contemplating redesigning operational practices in their jurisdictions to more effectively and efficiently balance decarbonising power systems and electricity markets. Given the challenges and complexities of the design problem, achieving these outcomes is likely to require implementing flexible, "second-best" and context-specific solutions.

This thesis aims to address the following research question:

> *Given existing design challenges and increasing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources as energy transition proceeds, how should we design operational practices for balancing electricity markets?*

The broad scope of this research question was narrowed through three research objectives that were addressed through modelling and detailed empirical studies of facets of the Australian National Electricity Market. In this chapter, I first summarise the main findings of the research within this thesis according to the research objective they address. Specifically, [@sec:conclusion-ro1] summarises insights from [Chapter @sec:fcs] that address Research Objective 1, [@sec:conclusion-ro2] summarises the findings from [Chapter @sec:reserves] that address Research Objective 3, and [@sec:conclusion-ro3] summarises the findings from [Chapter @sec:info] that address Research Objective 3. I then highlight potential opportunities for future work in [@sec:conclusion-future_work]. Finally, I provide brief closing remarks in [@sec:conclusion-closing_remarks].

## Research Objective 1 {#sec:conclusion-ro1}

> *To determine what features are needed in centrally-coordinated arrangements for procuring frequency control services during energy transition.*

Frequency control services are an important component of a system operator's balancing toolkit and are critical to ensuring that imbalances are quickly addressed. The design of frequency control arrangements in restructured electricity industries will need to be revisited as resource mixes, network topologies and broader market arrangements and policy settings change with growing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources.

Based on the review of North American and European frequency control arrangements and the analysis of the NEM's presented in [Chapter @sec:fcs], I offer four insights consisting of desirable features and design principles for policy-makers revisiting their jurisdiction's frequency control arrangements during energy transition:

1. Control deficiencies may not be addressable through introducing new frequency control services. While this solution may address emerging needs, such as low-inertia operation, policy-makers need to better understand the interdependency, interoperability and interchangeability between frequency control services and the interactions with other technical attributes of the power system (e.g. system strength) to ensure that frequency control is first and foremost effective. Once this has been achieved, the short-run efficiency of arrangements can be improved through mechanisms such as dynamic and probabilistic dimensioning and co-optimising the procurement of interchangeable frequency control services.

2. A dynamically efficient outcome in some power systems may require additional investments in capability. Prices for frequency control services can be strengthened through scarcity pricing, which may better reflect the system's preference for security and reliability. Such pricing mechanisms are complementary to appropriate and efficient cost-allocation based on causation or needs. Both efficient price formation and cost-allocation will improve the potential for frequency control services derivatives, which may assist in providing price signals for investment.

3. System operators should systematically and frequently verify frequency control service delivery, where relevant, and withhold or penalise remuneration when delivery is deemed to be insufficient. If such monitoring is in place, remuneration can be performance-based to drive the provision of high quality frequency control services. Performance monitoring would also enable the system operator to assess frequency control arrangements and identify any deficiencies in control action or procurement.

4. During energy transition, a suitable set of frequency control arrangements will most likely involve a combination of market-based and regulatory mechanisms. Frequency control is a power system public good and achieving frequency stability requires a degree of coordination and cooperation between resources. These characteristics make it difficult to establish complete markets for frequency control services, and an emphasis on market solutions may obscure these characteristics to market participants and undermine effective control. In contrast, regulatory mechanisms may prove to be more robust and resilient in the face of uncertainties, particularly those that are exogenous to the power system (e.g. climate risk). Regardless of whether arrangements are skewed towards market-based mechanisms or regulatory mechanisms, designers should be more forward-looking and avoid assumptions regarding the provision of frequency control capabilities over time, particularly when there is a pervasive competition norm and effective frequency control relies on sequential and hierarchical control actions.

## Research Objective 2 {#sec:conclusion-ro2}

> *To better understand how balancing flexibility capabilities in scheduling timeframes are changing during energy transition, and how these changes might impact the suitability and design of more decentralised operational balancing practices.*

There is a role for empirical studies examining whether decentralised operational balancing practices, such as markets for services and products, are purpose-fit to deliver the balancing flexibility requirements of electricity markets in transition – particularly given that new markets for flexibility (e.g. reserve product markets) can introduce additional costs, constraints and complexity, and even encroach upon the functions of existing operational practices.

By quantifying the time-varying spectrum of balancing flexibility *capabilities* in scheduling timeframes for historical and projected resource mixes in two regions of the NEM in [Chapter @sec:reserves], I show that with higher penetrations of VRE: 1) downwards flexibility margins can be exhausted around noon if wind and solar are unable or unwilling to provide it, 2) upwards flexibility becomes more scarce during morning and evening peak demand events and 3) a greater portion of upwards flexibility is provided by energy-limited resources. Based on these findings and an assessment of various flexibility design options, I recommend that policy-makers examine how existing operational practices can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility provision, and that duration specifications and sustained footroom procurement be considered for reserve products.

## Research Objective 3 {#sec:conclusion-ro3}

> *To explore how more decentralised operational balancing practices can be configured to maximise the deployability of balancing flexibility in scheduling timeframes.*

Solely examining *capabilities* is insufficient for determining the actual availability of balancing flexibility in electricity markets given that the latter is also shaped by market participation decisions. As such, I also examine some aspects of the *deployability* of balancing flexibility capabilities. In [Chapter @sec:info], I explore how market information, participation rules and participant operational strategies affect scheduling decisions and thus balancing flexibility provision from energy storage resources, which are widely touted to be critical to balancing decarbonised power systems. I first highlight the increasing frequency and severity of errors in AEMO-generated price forecasts, which are widely used by market participants in the NEM to schedule their resources, and propose a hypothesis that market participant (re)bidding is partially responsible for this phenomenon. I then model the extent to which BESS wholesale energy market arbitrage revenues might be reduced (compared to perfect foresight operation) should these forecasts guide battery energy storage scheduling. I find that revenue reductions can be significant, ranging from ~15–20% reduction in potential annual arbitrage revenue for a 4 hour BESS to 60+% for a 15 minute BESS. Based on the findings from these analyses, I discuss potential changes to market participant scheduling strategies and market design that could improve scheduling outcomes. I recommend that Australian policy-makers not only increase the frequency at which centralised knowledge processes are run, but also consider whether stricter market participation restrictions might incentivise participant bidding strategies that are less likely to induce sudden price forecast swings that can hamper effective scheduling.

## Future work {#sec:conclusion-future_work}

The broad scope of the research question and the various limitations of the work within this thesis mean that there are multiple potential improvements and directions for future work. In the subsections below, I highlight the most significant of these improvements and directions.

### Greater consideration of demand response and distributed, consumer-owned energy resources

While Chapters [-@sec:fcs], [@sec:reserves] and [-@sec:info] discussed how demand response and distributed, consumer-owned energy resources have impacted or might impact operational practice design in the NEM to some extent, it is critical for future research is to gain a deeper understanding of how electricity markets can harness the numerous benefits presented by demand response and distributed, consumer-owned energy resources offering balancing flexibility to the system. The financial benefits of doing so in the NEM are estimated to be 1.0–6.3 billion AUD by 2030-2040 [@australianenergymarketcommissionUnlockingCERBenefits2023]. There are three avenues for future work in this space that should be pursued:

1. Policy-makers must evaluate whether incremental adjustments to operational practices and market design offer material benefits. This involves not only advancing "enabling" reform, such as the flexible trading agreements [@australianenergymarketcommissionUnlockingCERBenefits2023] and central dispatch visibility and integration mechanisms [@australianenergymarketcommissionIntegratingPriceresponsiveResources2023a] being considered in the NEM, but also taking a holistic view when assessing seemingly unrelated reform pathways. An example of the latter is, as I discuss in [@sec:reserves-intro], that technical or market participation requirements for reserve product markets may ultimately hinder balancing flexibility provision from smaller resources.

2. Policy-makers must develop a vision for a target future grid architecture. An important component of this second avenue is determining the extent to which arrangements should be "layered"; that is, whether new distribution system operator roles should be created and what these new entities should be responsible for [@energysecurityboardConsumerEnergyResources2024; @kristovTaleTwoVisions2016; @schittekatteDistributedEnergyResources2022].

3. Research on the needs, preferences and motivations of energy consumers should be continued as arrangements change. Existing work has already challenged the notion that financial incentives alone (e.g. residential and business tariffs) are sufficient to unlock flexibility from demand response and distributed, consumer-owned energy resources [@ransan-cooperApplyingResponsibleAlgorithm2021; @adamsSocialLicenseAutomate2021; @robertsSocialLicenseAutomate2023].

### Interactions with investment timeframes

The design of practices and policies in operational timeframes should ideally consider those relevant in investment and planning timeframes as they are inextricably linked. For instance, as discussed in [@sec:reserves-intro], resource adequacy policies implemented alongside the operation of short-term wholesale electricity markets (e.g. longer-term firming revenue or capacity contracts) may weaken the case for building investment signals into or altogether implementing new markets for flexibility.

Holistic design processes should not only work from the "top-down" (i.e. from investment and planning to operational timeframes), but also from the "bottom-up". With an increasing number of countries adopting hybrid market arrangements ("auctioning of long-term contracts to support investment, together with short-term energy markets") to drive decarbonisation and satisfy security-of-supply requirements [@roquesAdaptingElectricityMarkets2017; @kepplerWhySustainableProvision2022], further research on contract design is required to ensure that long-term contracts preserve short-term market scheduling incentives. Neglecting this interdependency can have deleterious effects; for example, the contracts-for-difference issued to VRE resources through reverse auctions in Australia have provided project owners with investment support, but have also diminished real-time market price signals and thus incentives to assist with system balancing seen by project operators [@macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020]. A notable piece of work in this area is @billimoriaContractDesignStorage2023a, which investigates how the design of longer-term storage contracts affects the alignment between financial incentives for market participants and the need of the system.

### Empirical studies of market participant behaviour

With a specific focus on market information, [Chapter @sec:info] discusses behavioural factors and market participant preferences that influence resource scheduling. However, while most of the studies reviewed in [@sec:info-context-esr-operation] and the storage scheduling simulations described in [@sec:info-case_study-bess_simulations] *model* market participant behaviour, there is a need for more in-depth empirical research on market participant behaviour. Analysing market participant rebidding time series data could offer policy-makers with a clearer picture of how participants actually offer balancing flexibility to the system in their jurisdictions. The findings from these studies could be used to inform flexibility assessment modelling efforts (e.g. input bidding assumptions for market models). Moreover, such studies are important to understanding how market participants manage resources across a portfolio – a significant concern in jurisdictions such as the NEM that must contend with supply-side concentration and vertical re-integration (i.e. firms that operate a retail business whilst also owning generation assets) [@australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2022; @simshauserLessonsAustraliaNational2019; @chesterAustraliaNationalElectricity2024].

### Modelling the network

The system models in [Chapter @sec:reserves] assumed that each modelled market region is a copper-plate network with no interconnection to other regions, and the BESS dispatch models in [Chapter @sec:info] assumed that BESS dispatch is not restricted by constraints in the NEM's dispatch engine. As discussed in [Chapter @sec:reserves], transmission network constraints arising from thermal and stability limits are likely to reduce the balancing flexibility available to the system, whereas interconnection is likely to change the quantity and composition of balancing flexibility under certain conditions. Regardless, modelling both network constraints and interconnection will provide a more accurate picture of the extent to which balancing flexibility capabilities can be realised.

## Closing remarks {#sec:conclusion-closing_remarks}

This thesis adopts an empirical, "second-best" and context-specific approach to addressing the question of how should we design operational practices for balancing electricity markets with growing penetrations of renewable energy.

Through a review of international frequency control arrangements and an empirical study of arrangements in the Australian NEM, I offer four insights consisting of desirable features and design principles to policy-makers revisiting the centrally-coordinated arrangements for procuring frequency control services in their jurisdictions during energy transition.

Then, following a quantification of the time-varying spectrum of balancing flexibility capabilities in scheduling timeframes for historical and projected resource mixes in two regions of the NEM, I propose that policy-makers examine how existing operational practices can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility provision, and recommend that reserve products specify response durations and procure sustained footroom.

Finally, I explore how market information, participation rules and participant operational strategies affect the deployability of balancing flexibility from energy storage resources. Based on the findings from an analysis of AEMO-generated price forecasts commonly used for resource scheduling, I discuss potential changes to market participant scheduling strategies and market design that could improve scheduling outcomes. I recommend augmenting centralised knowledge processes and considering stricter market participation rules to discourage destabilising bidding strategies that may be hampering effective resource scheduling.

While there are several important avenues for future work, including greater consideration of demand response, consumer-owned energy resources and the interactions between operational practices and policies in the investment and planning timeframe, these findings will be valuable to policy-makers in the Australian National Electricity Market and other jurisdictions as their power systems progressively decarbonise. Furthermore, this thesis provides a framework for empirical, context-specific and "second-best" approaches to the design problem that is required for effective and efficient outcomes given the complexities and challenges involved in designing operational practices for electricity markets undergoing energy transition.
