## Research question and objectives

The research question that this thesis aims to address is outlined below:

> *Given existing design challenges and increasing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources as energy transition proceeds, how should we design operational practices for balancing electricity markets?*

As the full scope of this research question is not possible to address within a single doctoral thesis, I focus on aspects of the design problem that are encompassed by the three following research objectives.

### Research Objective 1

> *To determine what features are needed in centrally-coordinated arrangements for procuring frequency control services during energy transition.*

Frequency control services are a significant component of a system operator's balancing toolkit and are critical to ensuring that imbalances are quickly addressed. The design of frequency control arrangements in restructured electricity industries will need to be revisited as resource mixes, network topologies and broader market arrangements and policy settings change with growing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources. Existing literature on the design of frequency control arrangements has tended to focus on arrangements in a particular jurisdiction with limited consideration of international experience from jurisdictions with alternative arrangements. Furthermore, few existing studies consider the design problem through both an engineering and economics lens, and even fewer focus on what features are required to ensure that frequency control arrangements can meet the demands of energy transition for years to come. It is also worth noting that previous studies of the design of frequency control arrangements in the NEM do not capture recent experiences with deteriorating frequency performance, the reintroduction of mandatory requirements and the integration of high shares of VRE.

[Chapter @sec:fcs] aims to address these shortcomings in the existing literature and provide a perspective on what features are desirable in the market-based frequency control arrangements as jurisdictions decarbonise. In this chapter, I provide a high-level overview and comparison of the key features of frequency control arrangements in North America and Central and Western Europe, and identify the most prominent challenges to designing effective and efficient frequency control arrangements and potential solutions to these challenges. I then assess the performance of evolving arrangements in the NEM in delivering improved frequency control outcomes, with particular regard to growing renewable penetrations and evident tensions between mandatory requirements and market-based incentives. Based on this assessment and a discussion of the trade-offs between effective and efficient outcomes, I draw out four key insights on designing frequency control arrangements as power system capabilities and needs change: 1) Understanding control action interactions, 2) implementing efficient price formation and cost-allocation mechanisms, 3) monitoring and assessing service provision to better align participant remuneration with service quality, and 4) considering both regulatory and market mechanisms and their consequences and interactions.

### Research Objective 2

> *To better understand how balancing flexibility capabilities in scheduling timeframes are changing during energy transition, and how these changes might impact the suitability and design of more decentralised operational balancing practices.*

In wholesale electricity markets, market participation decisions determine the type and quantity of balancing flexibility available within scheduling timeframes. There is a role for empirical studies examining whether decentralised operational balancing practices, such as markets for services and products, are purpose-fit to deliver the balancing flexibility requirements of electricity markets in transition â€“ particularly given that new markets for flexibility (e.g. reserve product markets) can introduce additional costs, constraints and complexity, and even encroach upon the functions of existing operational practices. Previous studies have neglected this consideration and have, for the most part, proposed or relied upon flexibility quantification methods that are less useful to policy-makers assessing, comparing and designing changes to decentralised balancing practices. Furthermore, there has been limited work that examines how the duration of certain types of balancing flexibility might affect the suitability of certain decentralised operational balancing practices.

[Chapter @sec:reserves] addresses this gap in the literature by quantifying balancing flexibility capabilities in scheduling timeframes both now and into the near future to inform market design. In this chapter, I offer a practical method for quantifying the time-varying spectrum of upwards and downwards balancing flexibility capabilities, and then use this method to assess historical and projected resource mixes in two regions of the Australian NEM. The results from my analysis suggest that with higher penetrations of renewable energy: 1) downwards flexibility margins can be exhausted around noon if wind and solar are unable or unwilling to provide it, 2) upwards flexibility becomes more scarce during morning and evening peak demand events and 3) a greater portion of upwards flexibility is provided by energy-limited resources. Using these findings, I examine and compare the suitability of various flexibility design options, with a particular focus on assessing the need for an additional reserve product market. I recommend that policy-makers examine how existing operational practices can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility provision, and that duration specifications and sustained footroom procurement be considered for reserve products.

### Research Objective 3

> *To explore how more decentralised operational balancing practices can be configured to maximise the deployability of balancing flexibility in scheduling timeframes.*

Understanding the quantity of balancing flexibility available in a power system is inadequate if market participants are unable or unwilling to offer resource flexibility into wholesale electricity markets. Market participation decisions and thus resource schedules are informed by knowledge processes, which provide current and forecasted power system and market information. As such, these knowledge processes and, more broadly, market participation rules must be purpose-fit to enable resource scheduling that leads to effective and efficient system balancing. To the best of my knowledge, there are only a few studies that discuss the significance of market information and market participation rules in scheduling power system resources in electricity markets. However, none of these studies use empirical evidence to support scheduling or policy recommendations. Furthermore, whilst previous studies have examined the impact of imperfect foresight on energy storage resources with different storage durations, they do not simulate storage operation in fast markets (i.e. dispatch decisions every 5 minutes) with high real-time prices and significant penetrations of VRE.

[Chapter @sec:info] explores how market information and market participant operational strategies impact the deployability of balancing flexibility from energy-limited storage resources, which are expected to aid in balancing electricity markets with high penetrations of variable renewable energy through energy arbitrage. In this chapter, I focus on the scheduling coordination role of centralised price forecasts generated by the system and market operator in Australian NEM. I highlight the increasing frequency and severity of errors in these price forecasts, and propose a hypothesis that market participant (re)bidding is partially responsible for this phenomenon. I then model the extent to which arbitrage revenues might be reduced (compared to perfect foresight operation) should these forecasts guide battery energy storage scheduling. Based on the findings from these analyses, I discuss potential changes to market participant scheduling strategies and market design that could improve scheduling outcomes. I recommend that Australian policy-makers not only increase the frequency at which centralised knowledge processes are run, but also consider whether stricter market participation restrictions might incentivise participant bidding strategies that are less likely to induce sudden price forecast swings that can hamper effective scheduling.

### Case studies of the Australian National Electricity Market

Whilst this thesis aims to achieve these research objectives and thus produce insights for policy-makers worldwide, I draw on experiences from the Australian NEM and use its resource configurations and market arrangements in the case studies contained within this thesis. Research from the NEM should be of interest to electricity market designers elsewhere for several reasons:

1. Relative to other jurisdictions, the NEM regularly experiences high instantaneous penetrations of renewable energy (a maximum of 72.9% in November 2023[^8]) and *variable* renewable energy (a maximum of 71.9% in November 2023[^8]). As such, the changes in balancing flexibility capabilities and requirements in the NEM that are discussed in this thesis foreshadow those that are likely to occur in other jurisdictions as they decarbonise their electricity supply.
2. Similarly, the NEM has seen world-leading deployments of rooftop solar PV and other consumer-owned energy resources. These resources constitute a significant part of the resource mix (as high as 48% in a single market interval in October 2023[^8]). Electricity market designers worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned with the impact of these resources on system balancing and are considering how best to facilitate the provision of balancing flexibility from these resources to the benefit of both the system and consumers. In this thesis, I touch on the impact of consumer-owned energy resources on balancing, and which operational features and practices best enable these resources to offer balancing flexibility to the wider system. However, distributed and consumer-owned energy resources are not a focus of this thesis.
3. Many of the world's electricity markets are considering or adopting design features, such as short market intervals and faster frequency control service markets, that have long been a part of the NEM's design. As such, experience from the NEM documented in this thesis can inform how or even whether certain design features should be implemented elsewhere.

## Research methods

To achieve the objectives outlined in the previous subsection, I use three research methods: literature review, system and market data analysis and techno-economic modelling. In the subsections below, I provide an overview of these methods. I describe the methods used to address each research objective in detail in the methodology sections of Chapters [-@sec:fcs], [-@sec:reserves] and [-@sec:info].

### Literature review 

Academic and industry literature from the NEM and other jurisdictions on the design of operational balancing practices was reviewed to better understand the nature of the design problem, and the success of and remaining challenges with the implementation of various balancing practices. Though a detailed literature review was completed for each study, a large portion of the output from the literature review is in [Chapter @sec:fcs].
 
### System and market data analysis

Various analyses of system and market data from the Australian NEM were completed in [Chapters @sec:fcs;Chapters @sec:reserves] and [-@sec:info] to assess system and market outcomes, and to provide empirical evidence for market modelling assumptions (next subsection) and policy discussion in this thesis. Data was obtained using NEM-specific open-source packages including `NEMOSIS` [@gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018], `NEMSEER` [@prakashNEMSEERPythonPackage2023], the `AEMO Monthly Data Archive` tool [@prakashAEMOMonthlyData2023] and `nem-bidding-dashboard` [@gormanNembiddingdashboard2023], and analysed in Python and Julia [@bezansonJuliaFreshApproach2017] using `pandas` [@reback2020pandas] and `DataFrames.jl` [@juliadataDataFramesJl2023] , respectively. Plots were generated using `matplotlib` [@hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007], `plotly` [@plotlytechnologiesinc.CollaborativeDataScience2015] or `Makie.jl` [@danischMakieJlFlexible2021].

### Techno-economic (market) modelling

Techno-economic optimisation modelling was completed as a part of the work presented in Chapters [-@sec:reserves] and [-@sec:info]. In [Chapter @sec:reserves], two market regions of the Australian NEM were modelled using PLEXOS, a commercial power system and electricity market modelling tool [@energyexemplarPLEXOSEnergyMarket2021]. It enables scheduling processes and bid-based electricity markets to be modelled. The longer-term scheduling and market modelling problems formulated by PLEXOS were solved using the CPLEX solver [@ibmCPLEXOptimizer2021]. In [Chapter @sec:info], an open-source Julia optimisation package (`JuMP`) was used to formulate mixed-integer linear programs that were then solved to produce market participation schedules for energy storage resources with different storage durations and operational objectives [@lubinJuMPRecentImprovements2023]. Each of the optimisation problems was solved using the open-source HiGHs solver [@huangfuParallelizingDualRevised2018] on Katana, a high-performance computational cluster supported by UNSW Research Technology Services [@unswresearchtechnologyservicesKatana2023]. Results from [Chapter @sec:reserves] were analysed using `pandas` [@reback2020pandas] and plotted using `matplotlib` [@hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007], and results from [Chapter @sec:info] were analysed using `DataFrames.jl` [@juliadataDataFramesJl2023] and plotted using `Makie.jl` [@danischMakieJlFlexible2021].
