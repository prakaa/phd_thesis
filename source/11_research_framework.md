## Research question and objectives

The research question that this thesis aims to address is outlined below:

> *Given existing design challenges and increasing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources as energy transition proceeds, how should we design or, at the very least, approach the design of operational practices for balancing electricity markets?*

As the full scope of this research question is not possible to address within a single doctoral thesis, I focus on aspects of the design problem that are encompassed by the two following research objectives:

### Research Objective 1

>  *To determine what features are needed in centrally-coordinated arrangements for procuring frequency control services during energy transition.*

Frequency control services are a significant component of a system operator's balancing toolkit and are critical to ensuring that imbalances are quickly addressed. The design of frequency control arrangements in restructured electricity industries will need to be revisited as resource mixes, network topologies and broader market arrangements and policy settings change with growing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources. Few of the studies that examine the changes required in frequency control arrangements during energy transition consider the design problem through both an engineering and economics lens, and even fewer draw on past experience with existing practices to inform future design. 

[Chapter @sec:fcs] aims to address these shortcomings in the existing literature and provide a perspective on what features are desirable in the market-based frequency control arrangements as jurisdictions decarbonise. In this chapter, I first conduct an international literature review to provide a high-level overview and comparison of the key features of frequency control arrangements in North America and Central and Western Europe, and to identify the most prominent challenges to designing effective and efficient frequency control arrangements and potential solutions to these challenges. Then, through another literature review and data analysis, I provide an overview and assessment of frequency control arrangements in Australia's National Electricity Market, which, despite long-standing frequency control ancillary services markets, has had recent challenges in maintaining secure frequency control. I assess the performance of evolving arrangements in the NEM in delivering improved frequency control outcomes, with particular regard to growing renewable penetrations and evident tensions between mandatory requirements and market-based incentives. Based on this assessment, I discuss the trade-offs between effective and efficient outcomes, and provide arguments for more robust and forward-looking frequency control arrangements during energy transition. Finally, I draw out four key insights on designing frequency control arrangements as power system capabilities and needs change: 1) Understanding control action interactions, 2) implementing efficient price formation and cost-allocation mechanisms, 3) monitoring and assessing service provision to better align participant remuneration with service quality, and 4) considering both regulatory and market mechanisms and their consequences and interactions.

### Research Objective 2

> _To better understand how the **capabilities** and **deployability** of balancing flexibility in scheduling timeframes are changing during energy transition, and whether these changes impact the suitability of more decentralised operational balancing practices._

In wholesale electricity markets, market participation decisions determine the type and quantity of balancing flexibility available within scheduling timeframes. There is a role for empirical studies examining whether decentralised operational balancing practices, such as markets for services and products, are purpose-fit to deliver the balancing flexibility requirements of electricity markets in transition â€“ particularly given that new markets for flexibility (e.g. reserve product markets) can introduce additional costs, constraints and complexity, and even encroach upon the functions of existing operational practices.

[Chapter @sec:reserves] focuses on understanding balancing flexibility **capabilities** in scheduling timeframes both now and into the near future, and using this knowledge to inform market design. In this chapter, I offer a practical method for quantifying the time-varying spectrum of upwards and downwards balancing flexibility capabilities, and then use this method to assess historical and projected resource mixes in two regions of the Australian National Electricity Market. The results from my analysis suggest that with higher penetrations of renewable energy: 1) downwards flexibility margins can be exhausted around noon if wind and solar are unable or unwilling to provide it, 2) upwards flexibility becomes more scarce during morning and evening peak demand events and 3) a greater portion of upwards flexibility is provided by energy-limited resources. Using these findings, I examine and compare the suitability of various flexibility design options, with a particular focus on assessing the need for an additional reserve product market. I recommend that policy-makers examine how existing operational practices can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility provision, and that duration specifications and sustained footroom procurement be considered for reserve products.

Simply quantifying capabilities, however, is insufficient if market participants are unable or unwilling to offer them into the wholesale spot market. Market participation decisions and thus resource schedules are informed by knowledge processes, which provide current and forecasted power system and market information. As such, these knowledge processes and, more broadly, market participation rules must be purpose-fit to enable resource scheduling that leads to effective and efficient system balancing. [Chapter @sec:info] explores how market information and market participant operational strategies impact the **deployability** of balancing flexibility from energy-limited storage resources, which are expected to aid in balancing electricity markets with high penetrations of variable renewable energy through energy arbitrage. In this chapter, I focus on the scheduling coordination role of centralised price forecasts generated by the system and market operator in Australian National Electricity Market. I highlight the increasing frequency and severity of errors in these price forecasts, and propose a hypothesis that market participant (re)bidding is partially responsible for this phenomenon. I then model the extent to which arbitrage revenues might be reduced (compared to perfect foresight operation) should these forecasts guide battery energy storage scheduling. Based on the findings from these analyses, I discuss potential changes to market participant scheduling strategies and market design that could improve scheduling outcomes. I recommend that Australian policy-makers not only increase the frequency at which centralised knowledge processes are run, but also consider whether stricter market participation restrictions might incentivise participant bidding strategies that are less likely to induce sudden price forecast swings that can hamper effective scheduling.

### Case studies of the Australian National Electricity Market

Whilst this thesis aims to achieve these research objectives and thus produce insights for policy-makers worldwide, I draw on experiences from the Australian NEM and use its resource configurations and market arrangements in the case studies contained within this thesis. Research from the NEM should be of interest to electricity market designers elsewhere for several reasons:

1. Relative to other jurisdictions, the NEM regularly experiences high instantaneous penetrations of renewable energy (a maximum of 72.9% in November 2023[^8]) and *variable* renewable energy (a maximum of 71.9% in November 2023[^8]). As such, the changes in balancing flexibility capabilities and requirements in the NEM that are discussed in this thesis foreshadow those that are likely to occur in other jurisdictions as they decarbonise their electricity supply.
2. Similarly, the NEM has seen world-leading deployments of rooftop solar PV and other consumer-owned energy resources. These resources constitute a significant part of the resource mix (as high as 48% in a single market interval in October 2023[^8]). Electricity market designers worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned with the impact of these resources on system balancing and are considering how best to facilitate the provision of balancing flexibility from these resources to the benefit of both the system and consumers. In this thesis, I touch on the impact of consumer-owned energy resources on balancing, and which operational features and practices best enable these resources to offer balancing flexibility to the wider system. However, distributed and consumer-owned energy resources are not a focus of this thesis.
3. Many of  the world's electricity markets are considering or adopting design features, such as short market intervals and faster frequency control service markets, that have long been a part of the NEM's design. As such, experience from the NEM documented in this thesis can inform how or even whether certain design features should be implemented elsewhere.

## Research methods

To achieve the objectives outlined in the previous subsection, I use the following research methods:

### Literature review 

Academic and industry literature on operational balancing practices from the NEM and other jurisdictions was reviewed to better understand the nature of the design problem, and the success of and remaining challenges with the implementation of various balancing practices. Though a detailed literature review was completed for each study, a large portion of the output from the literature review is in [Chapter @sec:fcs].
 
### System and market data analysis

Various analyses of system and market data from the Australian NEM were completed in [Chapters @sec:fcs;Chapters @sec:reserves] and [-@sec:info] to assess system and market outcomes, and to provide empirical evidence for market modelling assumptions (next subsection) and policy discussion in this thesis. Data was obtained using NEM-specific open-source packages including `NEMOSIS` [@gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018], `NEMSEER` [@prakashNEMSEERPythonPackage2023], the `AEMO Monthly Data Archive` tool [@prakashAEMOMonthlyData2023] and `nem-bidding-dashboard` [@gormanNembiddingdashboard2023], and analysed in Python and Julia [@bezansonJuliaFreshApproach2017] using `pandas` [@reback2020pandas]  and `DataFrames.jl` [@juliadataDataFramesJl2023] , respectively. Plots were generated using `matplotlib` [@hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007], `plotly` [@plotlytechnologiesinc.CollaborativeDataScience2015] or `Makie.jl` [@danischMakieJlFlexible2021].

### Techno-economic (market) modelling

Techno-economic optimisation modelling was completed as a part of the work presented in Chapters [-@sec:reserves] and [-@sec:info]. In [Chapter @sec:reserves], two market regions of the Australian NEM were modelled using PLEXOS, a commercial power system and electricity market modelling tool [@energyexemplarPLEXOSEnergyMarket2021]. It enables scheduling processes and bid-based electricity markets to be modelled. The longer-term scheduling and market modelling problems formulated by PLEXOS were solved using the CPLEX solver [@ibmCPLEXOptimizer2021]. In [Chapter @sec:info], an open-source Julia optimisation package (`JuMP`) was used to formulate mixed-integer linear programs that were then solved to produce market participation schedules for energy storage resources with different storage durations and operational objectives [@lubinJuMPRecentImprovements2023]. Each of the optimisation problems was solved using the open-source HiGHs solver [@huangfuParallelizingDualRevised2018] on Katana, a high-performance computational cluster supported by UNSW Research Technology Services [@unswresearchtechnologyservicesKatana2023]. Results from [Chapter @sec:reserves] were analysed using `pandas` [@reback2020pandas] and plotted using `matplotlib` [@hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007], and results from [Chapter @sec:info] were analysed using `DataFrames.jl` [@juliadataDataFramesJl2023] and plotted using `Makie.jl` [@danischMakieJlFlexible2021].
