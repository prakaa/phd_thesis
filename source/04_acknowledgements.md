# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

I wouldn't describe myself as bold, but fortune has certainly favoured me.

I am lucky to have stumbled into doing a PhD with Anna and Iain as my supervisors. Thank you for taking me on, and for your wisdom, guidance and encouragement over the years. I will forever be grateful to you both for helping me embrace complexity and showing me the value of an interdisciplinary approach.

I am lucky to have met some amazing people within the Collaboration on Energy and Environmental Markets. Nick, thank you so much for our insightful chats, your incisive and constructive criticism of the work in this thesis, and of course, the whips and catches. I've learnt so much from your approach to software, problem-solving and life. To Sophie, thank you for our chats, the opportunity to work with you and for showing me the power of asking "why?". To Simon, thanks for letting me always interrupt your days for our very enjoyable chats on campus. Rohan, thank you for letting me crash your honours project and giving me the opportunity to work with you. Declan, thanks for all our conversations about modelling, electricity markets and energy policy. Ash and Declan, thank you for signing up to write that submission with me. And to the broader group, thanks for your kindness and for sharing your wisdom and experience. I've enjoyed hearing about your work and sharing mine at all the discussion groups over the years.

I am lucky to have had some amazing friends who have helped me along the way whilst also tolerating my sub-par banter. Christian, thanks for being generous with your time in proof-reading and editing parts of this thesis. To Vicky, thanks for your love and support during the early years. To my various housemates – Nicola, Jeff, Hayden (!), Kate and Sammi in particular – thanks for being there through my highs and lows. Owen, thanks for showing me you can mix work with pleasure. To my trivia team and frisbee group, thanks for the very fun distractions. And to my many climbing partners, thank you for keeping me safe and sane. To everyone I couldn't name here, I am lucky to be able to call you a friend.

I am lucky to have a mum and dad who have been very supportive and love me very much. Thank you for always being there for me and for reminding what is important in life.

I am lucky to have received feedback and support for the work in this thesis from many individuals and organisations. Thank you to Andrew Corrigan and Max Zekulich for sharing their data and analysis on frequency response and FCAS markets. To the team at WattClarity and to the Australian Energy Market Operator, the Australian Energy Market Commission and the Energy Security Board, thank you for the opportunity to present and get feedback on parts of this thesis. To the Australian Government Research Training Program and the UNSW Digital Grid Futures Institute, thank you for your financial support and to the UNSW Sydney Research Technology Services, thanks for giving me access to Katana. And to the various reviewers of the work in this thesis, thank you for your thoughtful comments.

Finally, I am lucky to have drawn the cards that I have in the lottery in life. I am immensely grateful to have been able to live, work and play on the awe-inspiring lands of the Dharug and Gundungurra people in a lucky country.
