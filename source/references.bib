  abstract = {Energy storage systems have the potential to deliver value in multiple ways, and these must be traded off against one another. An operational strategy that aims to maximize the returned value of such a system can often be significantly improved with the use of forecasting - of demand, generation, and pricing - but consideration of battery degradation is important too. This paper proposes a stochastic dynamic programming approach to optimally operate an energy storage system across a receding horizon. The method operates an energy storage asset to deliver maximal lifetime value, by using available forecasts and by applying a multi-factor battery degradation model that takes into account operational impacts on system degradation. Applying the method to a dataset of a residential Australian customer base demonstrates that an optimally operated system returns a lifetime value which is 160\% more, on average, than that of the same system operated using a set-point-based method applied in many settings today.},

  abstract = {Electricity demand-side management (DSM) programs are becoming increasingly important to energy system managers in advanced industrialized countries, especially those with high renewable energy penetration. As energy user participation is paramount for their success but has proven to be difficult to obtain, we explore the usefulness of the ‘social license’ concept, originally developed in the mining sector, to refer to the process of creating acceptance in DSM programs aimed at managing or controlling household energy resources such EVs, batteries, and heating and cooling devices. We argue that analyzing the attainment or lack of ‘social license’ may be useful to energy policy-makers and researchers for understanding public concerns with not only supply-side energy resources, but also DSM. We do so by (1) drawing attention to potential frictions between demands for flexibility on the one hand and social practices and habits on the other; (2) attending to the ways that users’ engagement in DSM programs is influenced by their sense of control and agency, and their trust in program providers; and (3) exploring the ways that users may understand their stake in the energy system and may participate in programs as collectives rather than simply as individuals. We argue that a ‘social license to automate’ could not only describe a set of tools to manage participation in DSM projects, but rather assess the ways users effectively feel part of new energy systems designed to serve them.},

We propose an insurance contract that suitably compensates energy storage systems for providing flexibility. Such a contract provides a wider range of market opportunities for these systems while also incentivizing higher renewable penetration in the grid. We consider a day-ahead market in which generators, including renewables and storage owners, bid to be scheduled for the next operating day. Due to production uncertainty, renewable generators may be unable to meet their day-ahead production schedule, and thus be subject to a penalty. As a hedge against these penalties, we propose an insurance contract between a renewable producer and a storage owner, in which the storage reserves some energy to be used in case of renewable shortfalls. We show that such a contract incentivizes the renewable player to bid higher, thus increasing renewable participation in the electricity mix. It also provides an extra source of revenue for storage owners that may not be profitable with a purely arbitrage-based strategy in the day-ahead market. We validate our analysis through two case studies.},

The standard approach to control power converters that use a linear controller to define a desired closed-loop dynamic along with a modulator to finally handle the power converter switches is discussed in detail. For this purpose, several modulation techniques are explored. Moreover, a design procedure for linear controllers to track constant and sinusoidal references is formally derived. This design considers the fact that the controller can be implemented ether in analog or digital form. Finally, some insights into controllers that do not follow this standard approach are also provided.},

  abstract = {In centralized markets, producers submit detailed cost data to the dayahead market, and the market operator decides how much should be produced in each plant. This differs from decentralized markets that rely on self-commitment and where producers send less detailed cost information to the operator of the day-ahead market. Ideally centralized electricity markets would be more effective, as they consider more detailed information, such as start-up costs and no-load costs. On the other hand, the bidding format is rather simplified and does not allow producers to express all details in their costs. Moreover, due to uplift payments, producers have incentives to exaggerate their costs. As of today, US has centralized wholesale electricity markets, while most of Europe has decentralized wholesale electricity markets. The main problem with centralized markets in US is that they do not provide intra-day prices which can be used to continuously up-date the dispatch when the forecast for renewable output changes. Intra-day markets are more flexible and better adapted to deal with renewable power in decentralized markets. Iterative intra-day trading in a decentralized market can also be used to sort out coordination problems related to non-convexities in the production. The downside of this is that increased possibilities to coordinate increase the risk of getting collusive outcomes. Decentralized day-ahead markets in Europe can mainly be improved by considering network constraints in more detail.},

This fact intensifies the difficulty of decision making in the power system context; therefore, the uncertainty analysis of the system performance seems necessary. Generally, uncertainties in any engineering system study can be represented probabilistically or possibilistically. When sufficient historical data of the system variables is not available, a probability density function (PDF) might not be defined, they must be represented in another manner i.e. using possibilistic theory. When some of the system uncertain variables are probabilistic and some are possibilistic, neither the conventional pure probabilistic nor pure possibilistic methods can be implemented. Hence, a combined solution is needed. This paper gives a complete review on uncertainty modeling approaches for power system studies making sense about the strengths and weakness of these methods. This work may be used in order to select the most appropriate method for each application.},

Discussions of impulsiveness in the literature of economics, sociology, social psychology, dynamic psychology and psychiatry, behavioral psychology, and "behavior therapy" are reviewed. Impulsiveness seems to be best accounted for by the hyperbolic curves that have been found to describe the decline in effectiveness of rewards as the rewards are delayed from the time of choice. Such curves predict a reliable change of choice between some alternative rewards as a function of time. This change of choice provides a rationale for the known kinds of impulse control and relates them to several hitherto perplexing phenomena: behavioral rigidity, time-out from positive reinforcement, willpower, self-reward, compulsive traits, projection, boredom, and the capacity of punishing stimuli to attract attention.

The short term frequency stability is related to limiting the RoCoF and frequency nadir within acceptable standards following a contingency. Failure to limit frequency nadir and RoCoF can result in the activation of RoCoF relays and under frequency load shedding relays, leading to generation disconnection and unintentional load shedding. This can result in blackout. In this work energy storage system (ESS) is deployed in the two-area power system for improvement of short term frequency stability. A capacity optimization algorithm and dispatch scheme are developed for the ESS. The capacity estimation algorithm determines the required capacity of ESS. The proposed algorithm estimates the required capacity of energy storage while considering the complete dynamics of conventional generators, wind turbine, and power conversion systems. The dispatch scheme operates the ESS to inject the real power in the system to improve the short term frequency stability. The proposed methodology is verified in PSCAD. Simulation results depict the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Our findings are supported by a short survey that was sent directly to our contacts in the system operators from our sample of ISOs. Against a background of rising distributed renewable generation on the electricity system, we discuss the international experience of ISOs with respect to their incentives to: maximise social welfare; manage the increasing amount of renewables and new participants; manage their overall actions for customers; engage in stakeholder participation and transparency.},

  abstract = {Recent increase in the number of natural disasters resulting in widespread, long-duration, and costly outages have brought the energy system resilience to the forefront. As system owners and operators seek to improve the system resilience, they often find it challenging to assess the costs and benefits of resilience investments. Costs are fairly well understood and measured, but benefits are less so. There are many resilience metrics that attempt to measure resilience benefit, but the existing methods for calculating metrics and incorporating value of resilience in energy decisions are not easily executed. To address this, we developed a method for modeling the value of resilience that is flexible and scalable across multiple types of models. This article describes a framework for incorporating duration-dependent customer damage functions (CDFs) into grid- and campus-scale planning and operations models. In two case studies, we consider how the duration-dependent value of resilience influences the investment and operation decisions. We find that in both cases, knowledge of the value of lost load provides opportunities to reduce the lifecycle cost of energy through adjusted investment or operational decisions. The primary contribution of this research is to integrate the duration-dependent value of resilience in energy decisions. This study will be useful to grid operators interested in reducing the value of customer losses during grid outages, as well as campus or site owners evaluating resilience investments.},

  abstract = {This tutorial paper presents the derivation of a simple, low order System Frequency Response (SFR) model that can be used for estimating the frequency behavior of a large power system, or islanded portion thereof, to sudden load disturbances. The SFR model is a simplification of other models used for this purpose, but it is believed to include the essential system dynamics. The SFR model is based on neglecting nonlinearities and all but the largest time constants in the equations of the generating units of the power system, with the added assumption that the generation is dominated by reheat steam turbine generators. This means that the generating unit inertia and reheat time constants predominate the system average frequency response. Moreover, since only two time constants predominate, the resulting system response can be computed in closed form, thereby providing a simple, but fairly accurate, method of estimating the essential characteristics of the system frequency response. © 1990 IEEE},

  abstract = {Investment decisions in the electricity sector are complex and depend on wholesale market and policy structures, attributes of investor firms that impact risk and financing, and the location-specific economics of investment options. This paper introduces the Electricity Markets and Investment Suite - Agent-Based Simulation (EMIS-AS), which models the evolution of the electricity generation mix under various market structures while explicitly capturing the aforementioned investment factors and imperfect information. EMIS-AS advances the state-of-the-art of generation expansion planning and agent-based modeling by incorporating various aspects of investor heterogeneity (e.g., differences in financial characteristics, technology preferences, and attitudes towards risk under uncertainty), a robust price prediction methodology, a methodology for updating investors’ forecast parameters using Kalman Filters, and endogenous representation of a customizable set of wholesale electricity markets including energy, ancillary services, capacity, and renewable energy certificate markets. Implementation of EMIS-AS on a test system highlights the strong role that firms’ heterogeneous attributes have on the investment decisions, generation portfolio, and resulting resource adequacy. In multiple instances, investment and retirement results diverge not only due to each firm’s own parameters, but also due to the actions and characteristics of other firms. Results also demonstrate how imperfect information and risk preferences can lead to suboptimal investment outcomes, which can require firm-level recourse actions with severe profitability implications. In addition, a comparison with a traditional generation expansion planning model highlights the ability of EMIS-AS to capture resource scarcity and early retirements caused by real-world imperfections that traditional models cannot represent.},

Following an instantaneous in-feed loss, regional variations in the estimate of inertia are obtained from measured frequency transients using installed synchronised phasor measurement units (PMUs). A method is proposed to first detect a suitable event for analysis, and then filter the measured transients in order to obtain a reliable estimate of inertia for a given region of the GB network. The total inertia for the whole system is then calculated as a summation, with an estimate also provided as to the contribution to inertia from residual sources, namely synchronously connected demand and embedded generation. The approach is first demonstrated on the full dynamic model of the GB transmission system, before results are presented from analyzing the impact of a number of instantaneous transmission in-feed loss events using phase-angle data provided by PMUs from the GB transmission network and also devices installed at the domestic supply at 4 GB universities.},

  abstract = {The material in this publication may be used in accordance with the copyright permissions on AEMO's website. FAST FREQUENCY RESPONSE IN THE NEM – WORKING PAPER ©AEMO 2017 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As the energy market transforms, the nature of frequency control in the National Electricity Market (NEM) will change as new services are likely to be needed to complement existing mechanisms. This provides opportunities for applications of fast frequency response (FFR) to play a role in complementing existing frequency control. The breadth and speed of technological change in the power industry is unprecedented and parts of the NEM are leading the world in terms of new generation penetration. Thus whilst urgency is needed, research and analysis is still evolving in how these new technologies can be best applied to large, complex power systems. This report aims to develop a common language for discussion across industry, and provide early guidance on the suite of FFR services that may be valuable in future to assist in the efficient management of power system security. In this context, AEMO invites stakeholder feedback. Figure 1 summarises the opportunities identified for FFR and how they relate to existing frequency control mechanisms in the NEM. In this way, FFR may be beneficial in:  Delivering faster frequency control and lower cost.  Reducing constraints on power flow imposed by risks of high rates of change of frequency.},

  abstract = {Battery storage is increasingly identified as being among the least-cost mix of technologies in the evolving U.S. electricity mix. This study explores the marginal capacity credit of batteries using a probabilistic, reliability-based, effective firm capacity method, which we apply for multiple battery power ratings, durations, coupling types, deployment locations, and dispatch profiles within a test system that is based on the Texas Interconnection in the year 2024. We find that the capacity credits for all battery durations depend on their ability to predict the timing of reliability events. Even 1–2~h forecast errors—resulting in early or delayed battery discharging relative to the onset of a reliability event—lead pronounced capacity credit reductions, especially for 4-h duration batteries. Coupling batteries with solar mitigates the uncertainty associated with a shorter-duration battery’s availability during reliability events, primarily due to the relatively high solar capacity credit in our test system. Coupled (or hybrid) system designs with oversized solar arrays, the ability to charge the coupled battery with grid energy, and larger batteries lead to the greatest capacity credit benefits of hybridization. We do not see evidence that the hybrid capacity credit exceeds the sum of the separate battery and solar capacity credits.},

  abstract = {Energy storage systems (ESS) have the potential to be very beneficial for applications such as reducing the ramping of generators, peak-shaving, and balancing not only the variability introduced by renewable energy sources, but also the uncertainty introduced by errors in their forecasts. Optimal usage of storage may result in reduced generation costs and an increased use of renewable energy. However, optimally sizing these devices is a challenging problem. This paper aims to provide the tools to optimally size an ESS under the assumption that it will be operated under a model predictive control scheme and that the forecast of the renewable energy resources include prediction errors. A two-stage Stochastic Model Predictive Control is formulated and solved, where the optimal usage of the storage is simultaneously determined along with the optimal generation outputs and size of the storage. Wind forecast errors are taken into account in the optimization problem via probabilistic constraints for which an analytical form is derived. This allows for the stochastic optimization problem to be solved directly, without using sampling-based approaches, and sizing the storage to account not only for a wide range of potential scenarios, but also for a wide range of potential forecast errors. In the proposed formulation, we account for the fact that errors in the forecast affect how the device is operated later in the horizon and that a receding horizon scheme is used in operation to optimally use the available storage.},

  abstract = {Many countries around the world have increased their renewable installed capacity due to a greater awareness of climate concerns. Under this new framework, with renewables being among the main generation sources, the literature warns of a dramatic change in price behaviour. Some of the most commonly claimed effects of having a significant proportion of renewable generating sources in the total electricity production mix include: (i) a systematic decrease in overall wholesale market prices, (ii) a higher occurrence of price jumps, and (iii) a significant increase in price volatility. The goal of the present study is to test whether these changes in price behaviour have actually come about. To do so, we focus on the Spanish day-ahead electricity market as a paradigmatic example. In line with the literature, it is found a statistically negative relationship between the renewable generation share and the day-ahead market marginal prices. As well, we have obtained statistical confirmation of the fact that renewables generation share volatility is transferred to price volatility, though similarly to other generation technologies. Finally, in contrast to the general belief that the introduction of renewable generation would give rise to extreme (positive) prices, according to our results, increases in renewables generation share reduce the probability of upward jumps in prices. The results obtained are of interest for portfolio managers, practitioners and regulators.},

This responsibility is dedicated to Ancillary Services (AS) that, in perspective to market liberalization, is the accountability of the System Operators (SO) to secure the requisite level of quality and safety. In the liberalized environment, AS are disaggregated from the energy generation, and can be obligated or compensated under market processes. SO seeks specific ways to define, procure and implement such services by managing active power for adjusting the frequency and reactive power for sustaining sufficient voltage profile throughout the arrangement. A comprehensive analysis of several techno-economical aspects of AS in liberalized electricity markets of a developed economy and emerging economies has been reviewed in this work. While attending the wide range of AS, the aim is to provide the promising knowledge of individual service by comparing different AS markets that exists worldwide, showing similarities and conflicts between various market models. Apart from conventional providers of AS, Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in several liberalized electricity markets seem to be a good provider of AS along with energy in order to maximize their revenue from these marketplaces. In addition to their types and definition, participation, contracting approach, selection of offers, dispatch criterion along with renewable energy participation in various electricity markets has been discussed.},

However, the use of climate projections has remained limited so far for a number of reasons such us the lack of consistency among climate projections, the inadequate temporal and spatial resolution, the climate model biases, the lack of guidance for users, and the size of data sets. In this work, we develop and assess a consistent ensemble of high time and space resolution climate projections that address these problems. First, a methodology for sub-ensemble selection is developed and proposed. Our ensemble dataset includes eleven 12 km-resolution EURO-CORDEX simulations of temperature, precipitation, wind speed and surface solar radiation on 3-hourly and daily time scales. These variables are bias-corrected for a more effective use into impact studies. The assessment of bias-corrected model simulations against observational data indicates reduced biases and increased coherence in projected changes among models compared to the raw climate projections. We provide a well-documented dataset for energy practitioners and decision-makers to facilitate the access and use of energy-relevant high-quality climate information in operation and planning. The new dataset is freely available via the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) platform.},

  abstract = {Low-cost electricity-storage technologies (ESTs) enable rapid decarbonization of energy systems. However, current EST cost estimates lack meaningful models to assess alternative market and technology scenarios. Here, we project the competition between six ESTs until 2030 and derive cost benchmarks. To this end, a system-dynamic simulation model operationalizes technology costs using component-based experience curves with cost floors for battery materials. We find that lithium-ion batteries are likely to outcompete alternative ESTs by 2030 across applications and largely independent of selected scenarios. This dominance can pose risks associated with technological lock-in. We, therefore, analyze different policy options and contend that it seems most promising to combine: (1) the support for development and commercialization of breakthrough storage concepts and (2) piggybacking on the strong improvement dynamics in lithium-ion batteries by fostering technology and knowledge spillovers that benefit the development of alternative active materials; battery designs; and adjacent, non-lithium-based technologies.},

  abstract = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: \textbackslash beginlist \textbackslash item High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. \textbackslash item One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. \textbackslash item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. \textbackslash endlist We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

  abstract = {The GB power blackout, that happened on 9 August 2019, was a unique stress test exposing fault lines brought about by the rapid changes due to the decarbonisation drive and penetration of smart grids technologies. It has demonstrated that, as a significant amount of new equipment and controls were added to the system in a very short time, the probability of common, hidden modes of failures has significantly increased. In the face of declining reliability, maintaining the status quo is not an option. While currently increasing the (N-1) security margin could prove to be expensive, the balance of costs and benefits is likely to change in future. Especially wider application of innovative frequency controls, including “virtual inertia” and Remedial Action Schemes, could help reduce the costs. Distributed Generation (DG) reached such a high penetration level that it cannot be treated any longer as negative demand. Traditional under-frequency load shedding should be made more selective. Interactions between the power system and other infrastructures are still poorly understood and there is a significant risk that if the current compartmentalised approach to their governance and operation is not changed, we may see more unexpected consequences of disturbances across the whole system.},

Stochastic programming models can be efficiently formulated using expressive syntax and models can be instantiated, inspected, and analyzed interactively. The framework scales seamlessly to distributed environments. Small instances of a model can be run locally to ensure correctness, while larger instances are automatically distributed in a memory-efficient way onto supercomputers or clouds and solved using parallel optimization algorithms. These structure-exploiting solvers are based on variations of the classical L-shaped and progressive-hedging algorithms. We provide a concise mathematical background for the various tools and constructs available in the framework, along with code listings exemplifying their usage. Both software innovations related to the implementation of the framework and algorithmic innovations related to the structured solvers are highlighted. We conclude by demonstrating strong scaling properties of the distributed algorithms on numerical benchmarks in a multi-node setup.},

Given the complexity of storage operations and multiple streams of value, standard contract forms are yet to emerge. While there is flexibility in the design of forward contract arrangements, flow on effects of design on incentive compatibility in dispatch, risk-trading and investment represent a critically important avenue of investigation. This article establishes six principles for government-initiated contracting and examines the incentive compatibility of storage contract designs. We find that that preferences for structural simplicity in contract design could introduce incentive incompatibility without careful consideration of the interactions between storage operations and investment.},

  abstract = {Australia’s National Electricity Market is an important global test case of the impacts of electricity sector transition in a large-scale liberalized energy-only market. The integration of variable and distributed energy resources has provided opportunities for clean, low-cost generation, but has also challenged existing market frameworks and resulted in a debate about the necessity for new designs. The market’s delayed and insufficient response to disorderly retirement and the need for certain system services have resulted in government and system operator intervention to bridge the gap. There are difficulties in securing timely new investment under policy uncertainty and integrated capital models. Furthermore, contributions to system services that were previously provided as a consequence of energy provision are not inherently provided by many new-generation technologies. A range of solutions have been proposed to address these challenges, although none to date have harnessed the potential of comprehensive alignment between operational requirements and economic signals. For example, the government’s flagship National Energy Guarantee, while providing a new framework for emissions intensity and reliability, did not address the ‘missing markets’ in energy security. Measures such as forward markets may provide hedging options, but are limited to energy. Centralized commitment could provide operating robustness, but might not be able to provide sufficient transparency of the various electricity value streams, as the experience of international markets shows. Furthermore, while reliability has taken centre stage in the policy discourse, system security is as important in managing a largescale complex grid with a significant share of asynchronous generation. We argue that an efficient and transparent real-time energy market must reflect the comprehensive operational requirements of electricity dispatch. This necessitates an extension of energy-only design to an ‘energy+services’ model in which efficient price signals are provided for the ‘missing products’ necessary for operational security. Clear service specifications provide transparent signals that enable clear price discovery and facilitate competition from new providers and technologies.},

  abstract = {One major avenue for policymakers to meet climate targets is by decarbonizing the power sector, one component of which is raising the share of renewable energy sources (renewables) in electricity generation. However, promoting renewables --in liberalized power markets-- creates a paradox in that successful penetration of renewables could fall victim to its own success. With the current market architecture, future deployment of renewable energy will necessarily be more costly and less scalable. Moreover, transition towards a full 100\% renewable electricity sector is unattainable. Paradoxically, in order for renewable technologies to continue growing their market share, they need to co-exist with fossil fuel technologies. Ignoring these findings can slow adoption and increase the costs of deploying new renewable technologies. This paper spots the incompatibility between electricity liberalization and renewable policy, regardless of the country, location or renewable technologies. The Paradox holds as long as market clear prices with short term marginal costs, and renewable technology's marginal cost is close to zero and not dispatchable.},

  abstract = {This paper reports the development and results of a model exploring the resilience of the Dutch electricity transmission infrastructure to extreme weather events. Climate change is anticipated to result in an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events over the coming decades. Situated in a low-lying coastal delta, the Netherlands may be particularly exposed to certain types of extreme weather(-induced) events. The degree to which the country’s electricity network may prove resilient in the face of these future events is an open question. The model focuses on two types of extreme events – floods and heat waves – and assesses two types of adaptation measures – substation flood protections and demand-side management. The model employs a network-based approach in assessing infrastructure resilience – explicitly representing the structure and properties of the Dutch transmission infrastructure – and extends previous work by accounting for key power system characteristics such as capacity constraints and cascading failures. From a practice perspective, the results offer a first indication of the vulnerability of the Dutch electricity transmission infrastructure in the context of climate change. These results suggest that the network displays some vulnerability to both floods and heat waves. Both types of adaptation measures tested are found to enhance resilience, though substation flood protection shows greater benefits. Whilst the model was specifically developed for the study of electricity networks, we anticipate that this method may also be applicable to other types of transport infrastructures.},

  abstract = {There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating how large penetrations of wind power generation in power systems contribute to increase the cost and the complexity of grid operations. Those costs and increased complexity are directly linked to the random nature of the wind over time, which requires system operators to carry more reserve capacity to cope with that randomness if current security and reliability standards are to be maintained. Moreover, as the frequency spectrum of the wind generation random process is relatively wide (from 10-6 to about slightly above 1 Hz), the reserves available must be capable to be deployed fast enough to counter this variability. Therefore, in systems with significant wind power penetrations the security-constrained unit commitment programs should be capable of capturing the reserve capacity deployment requirements entailed by the random wind dynamics. More fundamentally, however, what is required is that the dispatchable portion of the generation system providing reserves is flexible enough. In other words, there must be enough flexible capacity available to ramp up and down so to shadow the wind's caprices. In this paper, we formulate a modification of the classic unit commitment formulation ot assess the value of such operational flexibility in power systems with large proportions of wind capacity. We discuss some economic and technical indicators of flexibility.},

  abstract = {Friedrich A. Hayek (1899–1992) is known for his vision of the market economy as an information processing system characterized by spontaneous order: the emergence of coherence through the independent actions of large numbers of individuals, each with limited and local knowledge, coordinated by prices that arise from decentralized processes of competition. Hayek is also known for his advocacy of a broad range of free market policies and, indeed, considered the substantially unregulated market system to be superior to competing alternatives precisely because it made the best use of dispersed knowledge. Our purpose in writing this paper is twofold: First, we believe that Hayek's economic vision and critique of equilibrium theory not only remain relevant, but apply with greater force as information has become ever more central to economic activity and the complexity of the information aggregation process has become increasingly apparent. Second, we wish to call into question Hayek's belief that his advocacy of free market policies follows as a matter of logic from his economic vision. The very usefulness of prices (and other economic variables) as informative messages—which is the centerpiece of Hayek's economics—creates incentives to extract information from signals in ways that can be destabilizing. Markets can promote prosperity but can also generate crises. We will argue, accordingly, that a Hayekian understanding of the economy as an information-processing system does not support the type of policy positions that he favored. Thus, we find considerable lasting value in Hayek's economic analysis while nonetheless questioning the connection of this analysis to his political philosophy.},

  abstract = {Energy storage systems (ESSs) can increase power system stability and efficiency, and facilitate integration of intermittent renewable energy, but deployment of ESSs will remain limited until they achieve an attractive internal rate of return (IRR). Linear optimization is used to find the ESS power and energy capacities that maximize the IRR when used to arbitrage 2008 electricity prices (the highest of the past decade) in seven real-time markets in the United States for 14 different ESS technologies. Any reductions in capital costs needed to achieve an IRR of 10\% are solved for. Results show that the profit-maximizing size (i.e. hours of energy storage) of an ESS is primarily determined by its technological characteristics (round-trip charge/discharge efficiency and self-discharge) and not market price volatility, which instead increases IRR. Most ESSs examined have an optimal size of 1–4h of energy storage, though for pumped hydro and compressed air systems this size is 7–8h. The latter ESSs already achieve IRRs {$>$}10\%, but could be made even more profitable with minimal cost-reductions by reducing power capacity costs. The opposite holds for Flywheels, electrical ESSs (e.g., capacitors) and a number of chemical ESSs (e.g., lead acid batteries). These could be made more profitable with minimal cost-reductions by reducing energy capacity costs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The high-frequency trading arms race is a symptom of flawed market design. Instead of the continuous limit order book market design that is currently predominant, we argue that financial exchanges should use frequent batch auctions: uniform price double auctions conducted, for example, every tenth of a second. That is, time should be treated as discrete instead of continuous, and orders should be processed in a batch auction instead of serially. Our argument has three parts. First, we use millisecond-level direct-feed data from exchanges to document a series of stylized facts about how the continuous market works at high-frequency time horizons: (i) correlations completely break down; which (ii) leads to obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities; and (iii) competition has not affected the size or frequency of the arbitrage opportunities, it has only raised the bar for how fast one has to be to capture them. Second, we introduce a simple theory model which is motivated by and helps explain the empirical facts. The key insight is that obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities, like those observed in the data, are built into the market design—continuous-time serial-processing implies that even symmetrically observed public information creates arbitrage rents. These rents harm liquidity provision and induce a never-ending socially wasteful arms race for speed. Last, we show that frequent batch auctions directly address the flaws of the continuous limit order book. Discrete time reduces the value of tiny speed advantages, and the auction transforms competition on speed into competition on price. Consequently, frequent batch auctions eliminate the mechanical arbitrage rents, enhance liquidity for investors, and stop the high-frequency trading arms race.},

In Colombia these services are required to operate the national power system and the international connections with the neighboring countries. The system is influenced by factors ranging from system's topology to social and political aspects, such as the large number of terrorist attacks. In light of these particularities, we consider Colombia as a learning lab for ancillary services in the region. Colombia's power system relies on three ancillary services for its operation, namely frequency regulation, voltage control, and blackstart service. From 2010 Special Protection Systems were also added. In this paper we first analyze the technical aspects, operational restrictions, financial management, and the most relevant regulatory conditions of these ancillary services of the SIN. We also take into consideration the main regulatory characteristics and statistical data related to energy exchanges that have taken place between Colombia and Venezuela and Ecuador. Thereafter, we depict the main weaknesses and policy challenges that Colombia must address in order to increase the effectiveness and coverage of ancillary services in both the SIN and in the international interconnections. Finally, we propose new market oriented regulations to encourage investments and new tools for international connections. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

We argue that the fact that prices can score worse or better than consensus opinion in predicting the fundamentals is a product of endogenous short-term speculation. For a given positive level of residual pay-off uncertainty, if liquidity trades display low persistence, rational investors act like market makers and accommodate the order flow and prices are farther away from fundamentals compared to consensus. This defines a “Keynesian” region; the complementary region is “Hayekian” in that rational investors chase the trend and prices are systematically closer to fundamentals than average expectations. The standard case of no residual uncertainty and liquidity trading following a random walk is on the frontier of the two regions and identifies the set of deep parameters for which rational investors abide by Keynes' dictum of concentrating on an asset “long-term prospects and those only”. The analysis also explains momentum and reversal in stock returns and how accommodation and trend-chasing strategies differ from these phenomena.},

A vast range of energy system modelling tools is available, providing modelling practitioners, planners, and decision-makers with multiple alternatives to represent the energy system according to different technical and methodological considerations. To better understand this landscape, here we identify current trends in the field of energy system modelling. First, we survey previous review studies, identifying their distinct focus areas and review method­ ologies. Second, we gather information about 54 energy system modelling tools directly from model developers and users. Unlike previous questionnaire-based studies solely focusing on technical descriptions, we include application aspects of the modelling tools, such as perceived policy-relevance, user accessibility, and model linkages. We find that, to assess the possible applications and to build a common understanding of the capa­ bilities of these modelling tools, it is necessary to engage in dialogue with developers and users. We identify three main trends of increasing modelling of cross-sectoral synergies, growing focus on open access, and improved temporal detail to deal with planning future scenarios with high levels of variable renewable energy sources. However, key challenges remain in terms of representing high resolution energy demand in all sectors, under­ standing how tools are coupled together, openness and accessibility, and the level of engagement between tool developers and policy/decision-makers.},

  abstract = {For over twenty years, electricity market liberalization has advanced short-term market efficiency in wholesale markets, but little progress has been made on coordinated transmission and generation investments. With fast penetration of renewables, widespread of distributed energy resources and emergence of smart-grid and energy storage technologies, the stake is growing significantly higher for the long-term efficiency of liberalized wholesale markets with an aging transmission infrastructure. This paper presents a methodology based on a general framework of two-stage stochastic optimization model for analyzing interactions between transmission and generation investments. The methodology features economic effects of prices, incentives and welfare impacts under alternative coordination approaches and cost recovery mechanisms. Application to scenarios under efficient coordination, merchant transmission, and sequential coordination are illustrated using a simple radial transmission network. Interestingly, a Boiteux-Ramsey cost sharing rule produces energy prices and social welfare impacts that appear essentially indistinguishable from those obtained under efficient coordination.},

  abstract = {The Indian Power Exchanges that started in 2008 have remained highly illiquid with less than 10 \% liquidity in the day ahead market and short-term contracts after 14 years of operation. The dominance of long-term (25 year) Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with coal power plants have stifled the wholesale spot market development and may jeopardize the successful integration of 450 GW renewables being targeted for 2030. The coal PPAs are inflexible with a significant take-or-pay provisions and are also more expensive than renewable generation in many cases. Although there has been a recent effort to bring in renewables in the spot market, it took the form of a separate “green” day ahead market rendering the market fragmented. The focus needs to be brought back to a layered integrated spot market which needs to be the fulcrum of all trade be it renewables, cross border trade and eventually frequency control ancillary services products. While contracts are an essential part of any market, their volume, tenure and prices, however, must be informed by spot prices. If India needs to achieve its 450 GW RE target (by 2030), there must be a reform of the thermal PPA regime to bring this generation into the day ahead and real-time spot markets to form a liquid and efficient marketplace.},

  abstract = {The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in Europe requires market mechanisms which allow an efficient balancing of these sources. This paper analyzes the participation of renewable generators in the Spanish intraday market. First, the organization of the intraday market and the short-term market mechanisms influencing intraday trading are described. After that, day-ahead and intraday market prices, as well as intraday trading volumes, are used to study the behavior of market agents in the Spanish intraday market. Regarding renewable generators, the influence of support schemes on the behavior of these agents in the intraday market is also analyzed. This paper shows that the Spanish intraday market has effectively contributed to renewable generation balancing. Despite this, market distortions have incentivized some renewable generators to arbitrate between the day-ahead and intraday markets, giving rise to higher system costs. Based on the presented analysis, it is argued that these distortions need to be removed from short-term markets to incentivize market parties, especially intermittent generators, to reduce forecast errors over time, improving economic efficiency and avoiding the use of costly balancing actions performed by the System Operator.},

The article considers the influence of epistemic frames on energy policy decisions, and particularly the representation of energy problems, using a social constructionist approach and a case study of Australian electricity policy, the cornerstone of the nation's energy policy. Rather than contributing to the debate about the future of a country-specific electricity sector or a classification of differing conceptualisations of energy, the article focuses on ‘the explanation of energy’ by investigating the framing of Australian electricity policy from early 20th century Federation to the contemporary era. A six-question analytical grid is deployed to examine how debates and policies about electricity provisioning—and the ‘energy problem’—have been constructed and reconstructed. The article concludes that the framing and reframing of the problem of ‘energy’ over time represents a key mechanism through which the state has represented, constituted and configured its role in the nation and reflects broader transformations in ‘governing’.},

  abstract = {It is anticipated that the decarbonisation of the entire energy system will require the introduction of large shares of variable renewable electricity generation into the power system. Long term integrated energy systems models are useful in improving our understanding of decarbonisation but they struggle to take account of short term variations in the power system associated with increased variable renewable energy penetration. This can oversimplify the ability of power systems to accommodate variable renewables and result in mistaken signals regarding the levels of flexibility required in power systems. Capturing power system impacts of variability within integrated energy system models is challenging due to temporal and technical simplifying assumptions needed to make such models computationally manageable. This paper addresses a gap in the literature by reviewing prominent methodologies that have been applied to address this challenge and the advantages \& limitations of each. The methods include soft linking between integrated energy systems models and power systems models and improving the temporal and technical representation of power systems within integrated energy systems models. Each methodology covered approaches the integration of short term variations and assesses the flexibility of the system differently. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of these different methodologies are analysed. This review allows users of integrated energy systems models to select a methodology (or combination of methodologies) to suit their needs. In addition, the analysis identifies remaining gaps and shortcomings.},

Here, we propose a metric for the cost of energy storage and for identifying optimally sized storage systems. The levelized cost of energy storage is the minimum price per kWh that a potential investor requires in order to break even over the entire lifetime of the storage facility. We forecast the dynamics of this cost metric in the context of lithium-ion batteries and demonstrate its usefulness in identifying an optimally sized battery charged by an incumbent solar PV system. Applying the model to residential solar customers in Germany, we find that behind-the-meter storage is economically viable because of the large difference between retail rates and current feed-in~tariffs. In contrast, investment incentives for battery systems in California derive principally from a state-level subsidy program.},

  abstract = {Many principles underlying the design of restructured electricity markets that are in-use today were developed over three decades ago when power systems were considerably different than today’s and tomorrow’s systems are. Systems of the past typically relied on large dispatchable thermal generators to supply energy. This can be contrasted with power systems today, which are experiencing rising penetrations of weather-dependent renewable energy sources that have limited dispatchability. Moreover, many power systems are experiencing growing adoption of distributed energy resources and novel uses of electric energy by end customers, which adds to demand uncertainty and variability. However, these technologies also provide opportunities for more active participation of the demand-side in maintaining system reliability and service quality.},

  abstract = {In this paper, three practical operation strategies (24Optimal, 24Prognostic, and 24Hsitrocial) are compared to the optimum profit feasible for a PHES facility with a 360 MW pump, 300 MW turbine, and a 2 GWh storage utilising price arbitrage on 13 electricity spot markets. The results indicate that almost all ( \$ 97\%) of the profits can be obtained by a PHES facility when it is optimised using the 24Optimal strategy developed, which optimises the energy storage based on the day-ahead electricity prices. However, to maximise profits with the 24Optimal strategy, the day-ahead electricity prices must be the actual prices which the PHES facility is charged or the PHES operator must have very accurate price predictions. Otherwise, the predicted profit could be significantly reduced and even become a loss. Finally, using the 24Optimal strategy, the PHES profit can surpass the annual investment repayments required. However, over the 5-year period investigated (2005–2009) the annual profit from the PHES facility varied by more than 50\% on five out of six electricity markets considered. Considering the 40-year lifetime of PHES, even with low investment costs, a low interest rate, and a suitable electricity market, PHES is a risky investment without a more predictable profit.},

  abstract = {The rapid integration of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) into power grids increases variability and uncertainty of the net demand, making the power system operation challenging. Operating reserve is used by system operators to manage and hedge against such variability and uncertainty. Traditionally, reserve requirements are determined by rules-of-thumb (static reserve requirements, e.g., NERC Reliability Standards), and more recently, dynamic reserve requirements from tools and methods which are in the adoption process such as Dynamic Assessment and Determination of Operating Reserve (DynADOR), Dynamic Reserves Dimensioning (DRD), and RESERVE, among others. While these methods/tools significantly improve the static rule-of-thumb approaches, they rely exclusively on deterministic data (i.e., best guess only). Consequently, these methods disregard the probabilistic uncertainty thresholds associated with specific days and their weather conditions (i.e., best guess plus probabilistic uncertainty). This work presents practical approaches to determine the operating reserve requirements leveraging the wealth information from probabilistic forecasts. Proposed approaches are validated and tested using actual data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) system. Results show the benefits in terms of risk reduction of considering the probabilistic forecast information into the dimensioning process of operating reserve requirements.},

In control center operations, UC is solved repeatedly to adjust device commands based on new information about load, generation availability, renewable energy production, and other aspects of system state as uncertain conditions are realized. We develop a threelevel model including 24-h UC, rolling-horizon UC (RHUC), and economic dispatch (ED) and give formulations for the three problems including interdependencies. This framework allows for evaluation of, among other things, different periodicities of the rolling horizon problem and the benefits of more accurate forecasting information. Experimental results are shown for a 6-bus system and a 3012-bus system with wind generation in two wind scenarios. Although the generation costs are very similar, the deviation between RHUC schedules and actual deployment is noted to be superior for a 20-min periodicity compared to a 30-min periodicity. Additionally, less reserve is deployed in the 20-min RHUC case.},

Energy system modeling faces a transformation: accounting for changing meteorological conditions imposed by climate change. To enable that transformation, a community of practice in energy-climate modeling has started to form that aims to better integrate energy system models with weather and climate models. Here, we evaluate the disconnects between the energy system and climate modeling communities, then lay out a research agenda to bridge those disconnects. In the near-term, we propose interdisciplinary activities for expediting uptake of future climate data in energy system modeling. In the long-term, we propose a transdisciplinary approach to enable development of (1) energy-system-tailored climate datasets for historical and future meteorological conditions and (2) energy system models that can effectively leverage those datasets. This agenda increases the odds of meeting ambitious climate mitigation goals by systematically capturing and mitigating climate risk in energy sector decision-making.},

Most research in this area quantifies impacts on one or a few components and does not link these impacts to effects on power system planning and operations. Here, we advance the understanding of how climate change might impact the bulk U.S. power system in three ways. First, we synthesize recent research to capture likely component-level impacts of climate change in the United States. Second, given the interconnected nature of the electric power system, we assess how aggregated component-level impacts might affect power system planning and operations. Third, we outline an agenda for future research on climate change impacts on power system planning and operations. Although component-level impacts vary in their magnitude, collectively they might significantly affect planning and operations. Most notably, increased demand plus reduced firm capacity across generation types might require systems to procure significant additional capacity to maintain planning reserve margins, and regional declines in renewable resources might need to be offset by increasing zero-carbon investment to meet decarbonization targets. Aggregated impacts might also affect operations, e.g., through shifts in dispatching and increased operational reserve requirements. Future research should aggregate component-level impacts at operational timescales, quantify impacts on wind and solar variability, and contextualize climate change impacts within ongoing shifts in the electric power system.},

This paper describes how the best designs satisfy the twin goals of short-run efficiency-making the best use of existing resources-and long-run efficiency-promoting efficient investment in new resources. The core elements are a day-ahead market for optimal scheduling of resources and a real-time market for security-constrained economic dispatch. Resources directly offer to produce per their underlying economics and then the system operator centrally optimizes all resources to maximize social welfare. Locational marginal prices, reflecting the marginal value of energy at each time and location, are used in settlement. This spot market provides the basis for forward contracting, which enables participants to manage risk and improves bidding incentives in the spot market. There are important differences in electricity markets around the world, reflecting different economic and political settings. Electricity markets are undergoing a transformation as the resource mix transitions from fossil fuels to renewables. The main renewables, wind and solar, are intermittent, have zero marginal cost, and lack inertia. These challenges can be met with battery storage and improved demand response. However, good governance is needed to assure the market rules adapt to meet new challenges.},

Conventional synchronous plant, the traditional provider of services which ensure frequency stability - synchronising torque, synchronous inertia and governor response - are being displaced by marginally zero cost non-synchronous renewables. Such a trend has operational security implications, as systems - particularly synchronously isolated systems - may be subject to higher rates of change of frequency and more extreme frequency nadirs/zeniths following a system disturbance. This paper proposes UCED-based strategies to address potential shortfalls in synchronous inertia associated with high non-synchronous penetrations. The effectiveness of the day-ahead strategies is assessed by weighing the cost of the schedules against the risk level incurred (the initial rate of change of frequency following a generation-load imbalance), and the level of wind curtailment engendered.},

However, the intermittent characteristic of renewables urges for energy storage systems, which play an important role in matching the supply and demand of renewable-based electricity. The life cycle of these storage systems results in environmental burdens, which are investigated in this study, focusing on lithium-ion and vanadium flow batteries for renewable energy (solar and wind) storage for grid applications. The impacts are assessed through a life cycle assessment covering the batteries supply phase, their use and end-of-life, with experimental data from test set-ups. The battery composition is investigated in detail as a factor for the final impacts, by comparing two types of cathodes for the lithium-ion battery and the use of recycled electrolyte for the vanadium flow battery. Results indicate that the vanadium-based storage system results in overall lower impacts when manufactured with 100\% fresh raw materials, but the impacts are significantly lowered if 50\% recycled electrolyte is used, with up to 45.2\% lower acidification and 11.1\% lower global warming potential. The new lithium-ion battery cathode chemistry results in overall higher impacts, with 41.7\% more particulate matter and 52.2\% more acidification.},

Applying storage technology is a business decision that requires potential revenues to be accurately estimated to determine the economic viability, which requires models that consider market rules and prices, along with battery and application-specific constraints. Here we use models of storage connected to the California energy grid and show how the application-governed duty cycles (power profiles) of different applications affect different battery chemistries. We reveal critical trade-offs between battery chemistries and the applicability of energy content in the battery and show that accurate revenue measurement can only be achieved if a realistic battery operation in each application is considered. The findings in this work could call for a paradigm shift in how the true economic values of energy storage devices could be assessed.},

  abstract = {Energy-economy optimization models – encoded with a set of structured, self-consistent assumptions and decision rules – have emerged as a key tool for the analysis of energy and climate policy at the national and international scale. Given the expansive system boundaries and multi-decadal timescales involved, addressing future uncertainty in these models is a critical challenge. The approach taken by many modelers is to build larger models with greater complexity to deal with structural uncertainty, and run a few highly detailed scenarios under different input assumptions to address parametric uncertainty. The result is often large and inflexible models used to conduct analysis that offers little insight. This paper introduces a technique borrowed from the operations research literature called modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) as a way to flex energy models and systematically explore the feasible, near-optimal solution space in order to develop alternatives that are maximally different in decision space but perform well with regard to the modeled objectives. The resultant MGA alternatives serve a useful role by challenging preconceptions and highlighting plausible alternative futures. A simple, conceptual model of the U.S. electric sector is presented to demonstrate the utility of MGA as an energy modeling technique.},

  abstract = {The installation of wind and solar capacity in the electric grid can influence net load ramp rates and volatility, affecting grid stability and operating costs. In this study, the statistical analysis of load, wind, and solar data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) shows how wind and solar capacity impacts these grid flexibility requirements. Growing wind capacity shows only minor correlation with increasing flexibility requirements, and appears to correlate with decreasing flexibility requirements in some instances. Growing solar capacity might initially improve grid flexibility requirements, particularly volatility. However, beyond a certain penetration level (about 1.0~GW in this study), further solar capacity growth develops a direct correlation with increasing flexibility requirements if load patterns do not change. While adding 15.7~GW of wind power had insignificant effects, adding 14.5~GW of solar to the ERCOT grid increases maximum 1-h ramp rates by 135\%, 3-h ramp rates by 30\%, ramp factors by 140\%, 1-h volatility by 100\%, and 1-day volatility by 30\%. The geographic location and orientation of solar arrays influences these flexibility requirements, with fixed, southeast-facing panels providing a significant reduction. These results can inform strategies for managing the grid flexibility requirements created by growing renewable capacity.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing integration of renewable forms of generation, ageing network infrastructure, and rapid increase in peak load demand, flexibility is becoming economically more viable and hence significant role player in the future power system. There is vast amount of literature on flexibility covering research, demonstration and validation activities. Nevertheless, there is still no unifying definition of the term "flexibility" and consistent characterizing terms for "flexibility resources". The lack of clarity in definitions and concepts may undermine information exchange amongst stakeholders imposing hurdles on the transition from mature technology to in­ vestment decisions and deployment. System operators, for example, require better clarity for the technoeconomic evaluation of flexibility resources in their planning processes. This paper, by reviewing prominent flexibility-related publications, proposes a comprehensive flexibility definition and unified characterizing terms for flexibility resources. Furthermore, the paper proposes a taxonomy method which is applied to classify flexibility resources. The presented taxonomy method clears the confusion on "what-is-what" under the concept of flexibility. This paper also presents the benefits of unified characterizing terms in mapping flexibility resources to ancillary services. The benefits are illustrated by considering a realistic use case in a Norwegian distribution network.},

  abstract = {One of the significant limitations of solar and wind deployment is declining value caused by the limited correlation of renewable energy supply and electricity demand as well as limited flexibility of the power system. Limited flexibility can result from thermal and hydro plants that cannot turn off or reduce output due to technical or economic limits. These limits include the operating range of conventional thermal power plants, the need for process heat from combined heat and power plants, and restrictions on hydro unit operation. To appropriately analyze regional and national energy policies related to renewable deployment, these limits must be accurately captured in grid planning models. In this work, we summarize data sources and methods for U.S. power plants that can be used to capture minimum generation levels in grid planning tools, such as production cost models. We also provide case studies for two locations in the U.S. (California and Texas) that demonstrate the sensitivity of variable generation (VG) curtailment to grid flexibility assumptions which shows the importance of analyzing (and documenting) minimum generation levels in studies of increased VG penetration.},

Even if they provide more and more ancillary services to the grid, these may not be sufficient for extremely high penetrations. As the share of such generating units is growing rapidly, some synchronous areas could in the future occasionally be operated without synchronous machines. In such conditions, system behaviour will dramatically change, but stability will still have to be ensured with the same level of reliability as today. To reach this ambitious goal, the control of inverters will have to be changed radically. Inverters will need to move from following the grid to leading the grid behaviour, both in steady state and during transients. This new type of control brings additional issues on converters that are addressed in this study. A solution is proposed to allow a stable operation of the system together with a limited solicitation of inverters during transients.},

  abstract = {Electrical energy storage could play an important role in decarbonizing the electricity sector by offering a new, carbon-free source of operational flexibility, improving the utilization of generation assets, and facilitating the integration of variable renewable energy sources. Yet, the future cost of energy storage technologies is uncertain, and the value that they can bring to the system depends on multiple factors. Moreover, the marginal value of storage diminishes as more energy storage capacity is deployed. To explore the potential value of energy storage in deep decarbonization of the electricity sector, we assess the impact of increasing levels of energy storage capacity on both power system operations and investments in generation capacity using a generation capacity expansion model with detailed unit commitment constraints. In a case study of a system with load and renewable resource characteristics from the U.S. state of Texas, we find that energy storage delivers value by increasing the cost-effective penetration of renewable energy, reducing total investments in nuclear power and gas-fired peaking units, and improving the utilization of all installed capacity. However, we find that the value delivered by energy storage with a 2-hour storage capacity only exceeds current technology costs under strict emissions limits, implying that substantial cost reductions in battery storage are needed to justify large-scale deployment. In contrast, storage resources with a 10-hour storage capacity deliver value consistent with the current cost of pumped hydroelectric storage. In general, while energy storage appears essential to enable decarbonization strategies dependent on very high shares of wind and solar energy, storage is not a requisite if a diverse mix of flexible, low-carbon power sources is employed, including flexible nuclear power.},

Operating reserves are used by system operators to deal with unexpected variations of demand and generation, and maintain a secure operation of the system. This becomes increasingly challenging due to the increasing share of renewable generation based on variable resources. This paper revisits the current sizing method applied in Belgium, which is based on a static approach that determines the required capacity once a year. The presented dynamic sizing method determines the required capacity on a daily basis, using the estimated probability of facing a system imbalance during the next day. This risk is estimated based on historical observations of system conditions by means of machine learning algorithms. A proof of concept is presented for the Belgian system, and demonstrates that the proposed methodology improves reliability management while decreasing the average capacity to be contracted. The method is compliant with European market design, and the corresponding regulatory framework, and is of particular interest for systems with a high share of renewable generation. For these reasons a gradual implementation in Belgium towards 2020 has been decided based on the results of this study.},

This is demonstrated based on a case study of Suriname, considering scenario simulations and impact assessments for the 2030–2040 time horizon, for multiple load and climate projections. The recently developed REVUB modelling approach is utilized, which facilitates hourly-to-multiannual simulations, the latter being important for inter-annual variability assessments, and key for climate impact studies.

This paper is a review of published current practice in markets which are at the leading edge of this problem, summarizing their experiences, and aligning it with academic modeling work. We conclude that the ultimate goal for all markets expected to manage high levels of renewable generation should be a reserve setting mechanism which utilizes the best understanding of meteorological uncertainties combined with traditional models of uncertainty arising from forced outages.},

This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the challenges, and proposes relevant solutions, for BESS in providing FFR and general dynamic active and reactive responses under low system strength conditions. In particular, first we propose a constraint to describe the negative impact of low system strength on BESS phase-locked loop (PLL) stability and possible mitigation solutions. We then investigate the negative impact of large contingencies on BESS DC-link stability and active power control by introducing d-q current-power sensitivity factors and propose a solution based on reactive power prioritization that prevents converter-level instabilities while providing simultaneous active and reactive dynamic responses. Possible negative active/reactive power interactions due to BESS converter capacity constraints and the impact of the BESS operating point are also addressed. All these issues are investigated, and the proposed solutions tested, through explicit mathematical modelling as well as dynamic simulations of the South Australia's Eyre Peninsula weak grid.},

  abstract = {Preservation of the environment has become the main motivation to integrate more renewable energy sources (RESs) in electrical networks. However, several technical issues are prevalent at high level RES penetration. The most important technical issue is the difficulty in achieving the frequency stability of these new systems, as they contain less generation units that provide reserve power. Moreover, new power systems have small inertia constant due to the decoupling of the RESs from the AC grid using power converters. Therefore, the RESs in normal operation cannot participate with other conventional generation sources in frequency regulation. This paper reviews several inertia and frequency control techniques proposed for variable speed wind turbines and solar PV generators. Generally, the inertia and frequency regulation techniques were divided into two main groups. The first group includes the deloading technique, which allow the RESs to keep a certain amount of reserve power, while the second group includes inertia emulation, fast power reserve, and droop techniques, which is used to release the RESs reserve power at under frequency events.},

  abstract = {Grid connected electrical energy storage is expected to enable the integration of variable renewable generation in the future. As the electricity sector develops wholesale electricity prices will change, which will change the way in which storage technologies are operated. This study investigates the sensitivity of storage revenue to uncertain market variables. Results indicate that higher gas prices, carbon prices and average demand would increase peak electricity prices, leading to larger daily price spreads and increased storage revenue. Increased wind generation, however, would reduce opportunities for price arbitrage and lessen storage revenue. Wind power also affects the way in which devices are operated and changes the characteristics which are rewarded by the market. With increased wind capacity, storage devices cycle less regularly as operation is driven by substantial changes in wind power output, rather than daily demand patterns. As a result, slower discharge times are more favourable and revenue is more sensitive to rates of self-discharge. Furthermore, there is less variation in wholesale electricity price and consequently conversion efficiency is more critical to performance.},

  abstract = {Grid connected electrical energy storage could enable large numbers of intermittent renewable generators to be deployed in the UK. Many studies investigate the revenue which could be achieved through arbitrage assuming perfect foresight of electricity prices. In practice, storage operators will not have perfect foresight and will have to devise operational strategies using price forecasts. This paper investigates the impact of forecast accuracy on the optimality of storage revenue. The optimal revenue available is determined using linear programming and historic electricity prices. The results are compared to those found using dynamic programming and electricity price forecasts with increasing percentage error. A small scale lithium ion battery and a large pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) device are compared. The results show that revenue reduces at an increasing rate with increasing forecast error. The PHES device is more sensitive to forecast accuracy than the lithium ion battery. For both technologies, with a maximum error of 30\%, 80\% of the optimal revenue can be achieved. With increased capacity and significantly increased power rating, the lithium ion battery becomes more sensitive to price forecast accuracy.},

First, the study describes the probabilistic characteristics of the intra-hour net load variability and demonstrates that they are best captured by non-parametric statistics. Then, this non-parametric approach is used to determine simultaneously the hourly flexibility requirements at a given probability level for large and small, continuous and discrete disturbances. This approach allocates the required flexibility among primary, secondary and tertiary regulation intervals. The usefulness of this method is then illustrated using actual 1 min resolution net load data, which has been clustered to take advantage of seasonal and daily differences in flexibility requirements.},

This fosters the understanding of the mechanisms of these markets and, thus, allows the evaluation of the designs of these markets and their interplay. In contrast to existing literature, in our model the prices on the different markets are interdependent and endogenously determined, which also applies to the switch from inframarginal suppliers to extramarginal suppliers. Linked to this, the implementation of a specific assignment of the suppliers to the different markets is according to their production costs and their ability to provide balancing power. We prove the existence of a market equilibrium, analyze its outcome and contrast this with German market data. Based on this model, we assess design changes, partly stipulated by recent European regulation. This includes uniform pricing as a common settlement rule (effect: no truthful bidding in general), standardized prequalification criteria (promising measure for cost reduction), market flexibilization via “free energy bids” (no increased competition) and the alternative score “mixed-price rule” (no effect on the equilibrium).},

In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Variability is the expected change in generation and demand balance (e.g., load changing throughout the day and wind power resource change). Uncertainty is the unexpected change in generation and demand balance from what was anticipated (e.g., a contingency or a load or variable generation forecast error). Power system schedulers often use scheduling techniques throughout the day to match generation and demand. When, because of variability and/or uncertainty, the total supply of energy is different than the total demand, system operators must deploy operating reserves to correct the energy imbalance. The way in which they do this and, especially, the way in which they plan for this can dramatically impact the reliability and efficiency of operating a power system with large amounts of variable generation. Systems today have developed their rules and practices based on a long-standing history of operations. Many systems are even now learning new ways to change these rules and practices where high penetrations of variable generation are becoming apparent. Renewable integration studies that are assessing the impacts of future high penetration systems are finding that systems must find alternative approaches for allocating and deploying operating reserves. This report tries to first generalize the requirements of the power system as it relates to the needs of operating reserves. A categorization of the various types of operating reserve is introduced to give a better understanding to the reader and to link similar reserve definitions in regions that have different naming conventions. It also includes a survey of operating reserves and how they are managed internationally in system operations today and then how new studies and research are proposing they may be managed in the future with higher penetrations of variable generation. The objective is to understand the differences, the commonalities, and to inspire thought on how new methods or metrics would be better suited in this future power system with larger amounts of variable generation.},

  abstract = {Higher variable renewable generation penetrations are occurring throughout the world on different power systems. These resources increase the variability and uncertainty on the system which must be accommodated by an increase in the flexibility of the system resources in order to maintain reliability. Many scheduling strategies have been discussed and introduced to ensure that this flexibility is available at multiple timescales. To meet variability, that is, the expected changes in system conditions, two recent strategies have been introduced: time-coupled multi-period market clearing models and the incorporation of ramp capability constraints. To appropriately evaluate these methods, it is important to assess both efficiency and reliability. But it is also important to assess the incentive structure to ensure that resources asked to perform in different ways have the proper incentives to follow these directions, which is a step often ignored in simulation studies. We find that there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. We also find that look-ahead horizon length in multi-period market models can impact incentives. This paper proposes scheduling and pricing methods that ensure expected ramps are met reliably, efficiently, and with associated prices based on true marginal costs that incentivize resources to do as directed by the market. Case studies show improvements of the new method.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the importance and challenges of incentivizing flexibility during short-term operations of the bulk power system due to the increasing variability and uncertainty from growing penetrations of variable generation (VG). Operational flexibility can refer to many aspects of a resource's capability to support the power system, such as the speed, range, and duration of power output, as well as the ability to autonomously respond to frequency or voltage changes. Inefficient utilization of existing flexibility, or unwillingness of resources to provide flexibility, can compromise system reliability by not meeting the changing net load, and it can also lead to higher costs when an inefficient use of flexibility resources occurs. There are many existing characteristics of market design that incentivize flexibility in some manner. How they incentivize the provision of flexibility as well as the level of flexibility is still debated. We explore some of these existing market designs, as well as new market mechanisms, such as pay-for-performance regulating reserve and flexible ramping products, that aim to explicitly incentivize the provision of more flexibility to the system, particularly as a result of increasing VG penetration levels.},

  abstract = {An interconnected electric power system is a complex system that must be operated within a safe frequency range in order to reliably maintain the instantaneous balance between generation and load. This is accomplished by ensuring that adequate resources are available to respond to expected and unexpected imbalances and restoring frequency to its scheduled value in order to ensure uninterrupted electric service to customers. Electrical systems must be flexible enough to reliably operate under a variety of "change" scenarios. System planners and operators must understand how other parts of the system change in response to the initial change, and need tools to manage such changes to ensure reliable operation within the scheduled frequency range. This report presents a systematic approach to identifying metrics that are useful for operating and planning a reliable system with increased amounts of variable renewable generation which builds on existing industry practices for frequency control after unexpected loss of a large amount of generation. The report introduces a set of metrics or tools for measuring the adequacy of frequency response within an interconnection. Based on the concept of the frequency nadir, these metrics take advantage of new information gathering and processing capabilities that system operators are developing for wide-area situational awareness. Primary frequency response is the leading metric that will be used by this report to assess the adequacy of primary frequency control reserves necessary to ensure reliable operation. It measures what is needed to arrest frequency decline (i.e., to establish frequency nadir) at a frequency higher than the highest set point for under- frequency load shedding within an interconnection. These metrics can be used to guide the reliable operation of an interconnection under changing circumstances.},

  abstract = {The Paris Agreement limits global average temperature rise to 2 ◦C and commits to pursuing efforts in limiting warming to 1.5 ◦C above pre-industrial levels. This will require rapid reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases and the eventual decarbonisation of the global economy. Wind energy is an established technology to help achieve emissions reductions, with a cumulative global installed capacity of ∼486 GW (2016). Focusing on Australia, we assess the future economic viability of wind energy using a 12-member ensemble of high-resolution regional climate simulations forced by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) output. We examine both near future (around 2030) and far future (around 2070) changes. Extractable wind power changes vary across the continent, though the most spatially coherent change is a small but significant decrease across southern regions. The cost of future wind energy generation, measured via the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE), increases negligibly in the future in regions with significant existing installed capacity. Technological developments in wind energy generation more than compensate for projected small reductions in wind, decreasing the LCOE by around 30\%. These developments ensure viability for existing wind farms, and enhance the economic viability of proposed wind farms in Western Australian and Tasmania. Wind energy is therefore a resilient source of electricity over most of Australia and technological innovation entering the market will open new regions for energy production in the future.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, inertia in power systems has been determined by considering all the rotating masses directly connected to the grid. During the last decade, the integration of renewable energy sources, mainly photovoltaic installations and wind power plants, has led to a significant dynamic characteristic change in power systems. This change is mainly due to the fact that most renewables have power electronics at the grid interface. The overall impact on stability and reliability analysis of power systems is very significant. The power systems become more dynamic and require a new set of strategies modifying traditional generation control algorithms. Indeed, renewable generation units are decoupled from the grid by electronic converters, decreasing the overall inertia of the grid. ‘Hidden inertia’, ‘synthetic inertia’ or ‘virtual inertia’ are terms currently used to represent artificial inertia created by converter control of the renewable sources. Alternative spinning reserves are then needed in the new power system with high penetration renewables, where the lack of rotating masses directly connected to the grid must be emulated to maintain an acceptable power system reliability. This paper reviews the inertia concept in terms of values and their evolution in the last decades, as well as the damping factor values. A comparison of the rotational grid inertia for traditional and current averaged generation mix scenarios is also carried out. In addition, an extensive discussion on wind and photovoltaic power plants and their contributions to inertia in terms of frequency control strategies is included in the paper.},

Climate sensitive decision-making in companies is vital to addressing the urgent need for making societies resilient to climate change and entailed risks. Providing and using state-of-the-art scientific knowledge in decision-making, an integral aspect of climate services, poses great challenges for climate scientists and decision-makers. This article aims to contribute to more informed decision-making processes in climate adaptation by addressing the question “How can climate scien­ tists practically implement a transdisciplinary (TD) collaboration with an industry partner to reduce the gap between climate science and decision-making in industry?”. We present an engagement framework that provides guidance to address this question. This framework conceptualizes the engagement using two spheres of interests offering the opportunity to explore and widen their overlap as a common space. We present a case study where we apply this framework to a TD collaboration for climate service provision with a Swiss hydropower industry stakeholder; leading to four practical recommendations for effectively using the proposed framework: (1) Secure an anchor person at management level of the decision-maker entity, (2) Be prepared to invest time into triggering and maintaining active engagement by all collaborators, (3) From the start, communicate the open nature of insights and solutions from the engagement process, (4) Be aware that you are working in a field of tension. The presented engagement framework and practical recommendations are particularly beneficial for climate scien­ tists that are not yet familiar with TD collaborations and enables co-development of bespoke climate services.},

  abstract = {Global decarbonisation is driving investments in intermittent renewable generation, with most plant entering the market by way of a Power Purchase Agreement. In Australia’s National Electricity Market, a surprising number of renewable generators have entered on a merchant basis. To maintain tractable revenues some minimum level of hedging is required, but in an energy-only electricity market with a very high market price cap, merchant intermittent generators require some level of associated firming capacity to ensure spot price exposures can be adequately managed. This article uses unit commitment, battery arbitrage and stochastic discounted cashflow valuation models to compare an Open Cycle Gas Turbine and a battery as firming options for a hypothetical wind farm in the South Australian region of the NEM. Using historic market data from 2010–2020, we find OCGT firming capacity helps the wind farm to generate consistent net cash flows, allowing it to withstand the highs and lows of spot market prices whilst covering required contract-for-difference payments associated with hedging. When battery firming is deployed, the wind farm/ battery portfolio generated higher cash flows at specific times, reflecting participation in price arbitrage under low spot price scenarios. However, battery performance was constrained by costly storage capacity.},

  abstract = {Energy Systems Modelling is growing in relevance on providing insights and strategies to plan a carbon-neutral future. The implementation of an effective energy transition plan faces multiple challenges, spanning from the integration of the operations of different energy carriers and sectors to the consideration of multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. In this review, we outline these challenges and discuss how they have been tackled by the current literature, as well as pointing at directions for future research. Many of the existing reviews identify a list of challenges common to most models, but they tend to be grouped according to type or energy carrier. Here we take a new approach and structure both well-established models and solution approaches along with the main challenges that energy modelling will have to deal with in the near future. We focus on four main current challenges that energy system models face: time and space; uncertainty; multi-energy; energy behaviour and energy transition. The main findings suggest that: demand-side management applied to multi-carrier energy system models lacks; prosumers is explored only in a limited manner; general, multi-scale modelling frameworks should be established and considered both in the dimensions of time, space, technology and energy carrier; long term energy system models tend to address uncertainty scarcely; there is a lack of studies modelling uncertainties related to emerging technologies and; modelling of energy consumer behaviour is one of the major aspect of future research.},

  abstract = {Wind power generation differs from conventional thermal generation due to the stochastic nature of wind. Thus wind power forecasting plays a key role in dealing with the challenges of balancing supply and demand in any electricity system, given the uncertainty associated with the wind farm power output. Accurate wind power forecasting reduces the need for additional balancing energy and reserve power to integrate wind power. Wind power forecasting tools enable better dispatch, scheduling and unit commitment of thermal generators, hydro plant and energy storage plant and more competitive market trading as wind power ramps up and down on the grid. This paper presents an in-depth review of the current methods and advances in wind power forecasting and prediction. Firstly, numerical wind prediction methods from global to local scales, ensemble forecasting, upscaling and downscaling processes are discussed. Next the statistical and machine learning approach methods are detailed. Then the techniques used for benchmarking and uncertainty analysis of forecasts are overviewed, and the performance of various approaches over different forecast time horizons is examined. Finally, current research activities, challenges and potential future developments are appraised. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Thus, particularly when economies are industrializing, and their energy systems are being transformed and are not yet fully locked-in, policymakers should take care before directing their economies onto energy-intensive pathways that are likely to be detrimental to their long-run prosperity.},

We evaluate the effect on curtailment from various flexibility approaches, including storage, thermal generator flexibility, operating reserve eligibility rules, transmission constraints, and temporal resolution, by using a highly resolved realistic system. Results reveal two aspects of a curtailment paradox as the system evolves to higher solar penetration levels. First, thermal generator parameters, especially in restricting minimum operating levels and ramp rates, affect VRE curtailment more in mid-PV penetration levels (∼25\%–40\%) but much less at lower (∼20\%) or higher (∼45\%) PV penetration levels. Second, although allowing VRE and storage to provide operating reserve results in significant operating costs and curtailment benefits, the price suppression effect from these resources reduces incentives for PV to provide operating reserves with curtailed energy.},

  abstract = {In competitive wholesale electricity markets, significant effort is devoted to designing markets that set efficient prices for maintaining supply-demand balance. One factor that can impact prices is administratively-set scarcity pricing, which sets prices to a preset level when the market is not able to meet operating reserve or energy requirements. When energy and operating reserves are co-optimized, assumptions surrounding operating reserve requirements and scarcity pricing can impact system-wide price outcomes for both operating reserves and energy. This study uses production cost modeling of an ERCOT-like system to evaluate the impact of operating reserve eligibility, scarcity pricing, and quantity rules on electricity prices, and therefore also on generator revenues. Results reveal economic and operational benefits with allowing open participation in reserve markets, as this enables greater access to the full set of capable resources at lowest cost. Furthermore, both energy and reserve prices are strongly impacted by reserve scarcity pricing events, which reveals that reserve scarcity pricing assumptions can impact price outcomes even for units not providing reserves. This study highlights the importance of operating reserve scarcity pricing rules because of the strong coupling between energy and reserve prices and because these rules serve as proxies for true price responsive demand.},

  abstract = {The electric utility industry is an important player in the climate change arena, both as a significant emitter of global emissions and as an industry vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. A climate risk management approach uses risk assessments and decision analyses to identify potential adaptation options. We review the existing literature on climate risk management in the electric utility industry, with a focus on four areas of interest: (1) climate change impacts; (2) measurements of risk; (3) stakeholder engagement and cross-sectoral collaboration; and (4) adaptation actions. Overall, we find significant emphasis on the identification of potential climate change impacts and opportunities for adaptation, but less attention paid to assessments of risk, stakeholder engagement, and cross-sectoral collaboration in climate risk management. We find considerable diversity in the types of adaptation actions, methods for measuring risk, and mechanisms for engaging stakeholders. We offer some suggestions to move beyond more fragmented approaches to climate risk management, including the adoption of more holistic approaches, heightened stakeholder and cross-sectoral engagement, and greater collaboration between researchers and electric utilities.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews operational flexibility and emissions of gas- and coal-fired power plants today and in the future with higher renewables. Six study cases were considered: heavy duty gas turbines in simple and combined cycle, aero-derivative gas turbines, large-scale supercritical coal power plants and small- and mid-scale sub-critical coal power plants. The most critical operational processes and pollutants associated with these plants were identified. Then, data was collected mainly from manufacturers, but also from academic research and grey literature. The data was compared and analyzed. Detailed comparisons of the power plant characteristics as well as the current and future flexibility and emissions are provided. Furthermore, a method to quantify the ability of conventional power plants to back-up renewables and the expected benefits from improved flexibility is proposed and evaluated. Results show that gas-fired power plants are not only more efficient, but also faster and generally less polluting than coal-fired power plants. However, at their respective minimum complaint load, gas plants are less flexible and produced more NOx and CO emissions than coal-fired power plants. Results also show that on average, an improvement of approximately 50\% to 100\% on power ramp rates, minimum power load, number of major power cycles and emissions for these plants is sought in the future to complement renewables.},

  abstract = {The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is undergoing rapid change as utility-scale wind, solar and now battery storage technologies enter the market. The impact of these changes on the operation of the NEM is of interest to a potentially wide range of stakeholders including researchers, market participants, consultants and energy NGOs. Detailed operational data is essential in assisting these stakeholders to understand these impacts and possible future outcomes in the NEM. Open data and open-source software for energy are increasingly seen as key to improving transparency and reproducibility, and therefore productive discussion on energy policy and market reform amongst a wide range of stakeholders. There is an excellent opportunity to further these aims in the NEM, due to high levels of transparency around market data, with the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) releasing nearly all the data used in the central dispatch process. However, a significant processing and interpretation overhead exists when analysing the large and often complex datasets made available to the public. This paper reports on a new open-source software tool, NEMOSIS NEM Open Source Information Service, NEMOSIS, which aims to lower this overhead and improve the accessibility of data sourced from AEMO. While a number of similar proprietary tools exist and are widely used by industry stakeholders, NEMOSIS offers additional benefits. It is completely open to modification and extension with the source code available on GitHub, while also being highly portable with the ability to package the tool as an executable file and operate it via a graphical user interface. It complements some other open source data tools for the NEM by providing access to a wide selection of data without the need for the user to have any coding knowledge. To demonstrate the use of NEMOSIS, this paper presents two examples of how it can be used to assess utility-scale renewable generator performance; firstly, with a simple example that outlines how to access 5 minute dispatch data for all scheduled generators in the NEM, and then, a second more complex example explains the implementation of a custom data table of plant performance statistics.},

  abstract = {The concept of flexibility is not one you find in standard microeconomics textbooks, yet it already plays a major role in the remuneration of the resources that generate and consume electricity every day and is likely to play an even larger role with the penetration of large intermittent renewable capacities. In this paper we attempt to quantify the net revenues that can be captured by a flexible resource able to react to the short term price variations on the day-ahead and intraday markets in Germany. We find that the difference between day-ahead and intraday revenues for a flexible resource has been increasing (although the profitability has been decreasing on both markets). This difference is more pronounced once 15 mn price variations can be captured by a flexible resource. The net revenues from the local 15 mn auction (which is held 3 h after the hourly “coupled” day-ahead auction) are more than eight times higher than the day-ahead hourly auction but below the net revenues that can be captured with the high prices from the continuous market. The results of the backward-looking empirical estimations allow us to distinguish and quantify two components of flexibility: (1) the “immediacy” value as we are approaching real-time and the urgency of the delivery increases (this value is revealed during the continuous intraday process and is highly linked to the stochastic nature of power supply and demand (i.e., wind/solar forecasts, forced outages of thermal generation,…) forecast error risk), and (2) the “ramping capability” component based on the technical characteristics as a resource can react to variations of shorter granularity (15 mn vs. 60 mn). We model and quantify the ramping capability component using a geometric brownian motion with jumps.},

The paper presents a system operator's utility function to calculate the exchange rates in monetary values between different frequency response products in the electricity system. We then use the utility function in a two-sided Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism combined of two frequency response products – enhanced and primary – in the context of the system in Great Britain. This mechanism would allow the market to reveal to the system operator the welfare optimal mix of speed of frequency response and quantity to procure. We show that this mechanism is the efficient way to support new faster sources of frequency response, such as could be provided by grid scale batteries.},

Although these exchanges did not result in an integrated discipline, they had important effects on all disciplines involved. The paper describes these exchanges from the 1930s onwards, focusing on two episodes in particular: an attempted synthesis by psychiatrist George Ainslie and others in the 1970s; and the attempted application of this new discounting model by a generation of economists and psychologists in the 1980s, which ultimately ended in the               diversity of measurements disappointment               . I draw four main conclusions. First, multiple notions of temporal discounting must be conceptually distinguished. Second, behavioral economics is not an integration or unification of psychology and economics. Third, the analysis identifies some central disciplinary markers that distinguish modeling strategies in economics and psychology. Finally, it offers a case of interdisciplinary success that does not fit the currently dominant account of interdisciplinarity as integration.},

However, SGs powered by fossil fuels are operating to a lesser extent and scheduled for decommissioning in the National Electricity Market (NEM) of Australia due to the accelerating increase of low bidding priced asynchronous generation of wind and solar, which leads to the reduction and even in some cases, a shortage of system strength and inertia. This paper comprehensively reviews the requirements of system strength and inertia in the NEM from an operational security perspective. Australia is the first country that established the regulation rules of system strength and inertia to accommodate issues of an emerging high penetration level of non-synchronous renewable generation.},

  abstract = {Synchronous generators are operating for less time than before or being decommissioned in the National Electricity Market (NEM) of Australia, due to the proliferation of asynchronous wind and solar generation. Sub-networks of the NEM will face inertia shortages in the near future. This paper develops a formulation of zonal inertia constrained generator dispatch for power systems with a diversified generator portfolio including synchronous generators, synchronous condensers, inverter-interfaced generators and energy storages. Zonal inertia constraints are formulated in unit commitment and optimal power flow to limit the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) in the event of network separation. Load frequency relief is also considered to reduce the ramp rate requirement of primary reserve. The proposed formulation can reduce the average cost of primary reserve and maintain zonal inertia adequacy to constrain RoCoF in case of the trip of the interconnector(s).},

The analysis combines the work of Wolfgang Streeck together with that of ecological modernisation to trace the fate of an environmental norm as it emerges within a complex pre-existing institutional context comprising social norms around accessibility, affordability and reliability as well as the more recent emphasis on the benefits of competition. The analysis shows how ‘strong’ forms of ecological modernist policy change, policies in which environmental norms were explicit, were vulnerable to carbon intensive businesses arguing that they posed too significant a social risk. Yet, solar PV has been associated with ‘weaker’ forms of ecological modernist policy development where solar proponents have succeeded in demonstrating, despite significant opposition, how solar PV can be embedded within the competition norm thereby promoting both competition and environmental goals. This weaker form of ecological modernist change may have far reaching unintended consequences as solar PV on residential houses enhances the capacity of those households as ‘prosumers’ to ensure their interests are better supported. An environmental norm may be established here but social norms around rights to an essential service may also be placed at risk.},

Although it is well known that longduration outages severely impact economies, such outages are usually not well characterized or modeled in grid infrastructure planning tools. Here, we bring together data and modeling techniques and show how they can be used to characterize and model long-duration outages. We illustrate how to integrate outages in planning tools for one promising mode of resilient energy supply—microgrids. Failing to treat these extremes in models can lead to microgrid designs (1) that do not realize their full value of resilience, since models do not see the benefits of protecting against extremes, and (2) that appear reliable on paper yet do not actually protect against extremes. Although utilities record power interruptions, lack of access to that data is hindering research on resilience; making datasets available publicly would substantially aid efforts to improve grid planning tools.},

We apply definitions of ‘emergent’ (uncoordinated) and ‘purposive’ (coordinated) disruption to a systematic review on how energy systems models and scenarios have been used to capture disruption and discontinuity. We first conducted a review of reviews of energy models and scenarios to provide an overview of their common classifications. Additional searches then sought studies which use different types of models and scenarios to explore disruption and discontinuity. We analyse a subset of 30 of these modelling or scenario studies in which authors self-identify and represent disruption or discontinuity, finding that the most frequently used methods were qualitative, exploratory foresight scenarios or agent-based models. We conclude that policy makers could prepare more effectively for social, economic and political disruption by integrating multidisciplinary insights from social and political sciences, engineering and economics through a broader range of methods: exploratory, foresight scenarios, simulation and agent-based models and repurposed energy systems optimisation models.},

The aim of the present paper is to provide an overview on the latest advancements of system operators regarding the analysis and mitigation of the reducing inertia. The theoretical background of power system stability and the calculation of the rate of frequency change are introduced to highlight the importance and the weaknesses of certain metrics used by system operators. Specific operational experiences are compared based on peak load and the nature of the systems. Possible responses by system operators which are discussed in the paper include synchronous and synthetic (emulated) inertia, other technical alternatives (virtual synchronous machines, adaptive load‐shedding schemes), and market‐based solutions. Besides summarising the advantages and disadvantages of those, grey areas of regulation and market structure are highlighted to facilitate forward‐thinking.},

The ongoing energy transition is affecting how much flexibility is required, but also who should provide it: some existing solutions are being phased out, while new solutions’ entire business models are based on providing flexibility (e.g. storage or demand response). With the intention of condensing information and rationalising debates, a significant number of methods have been proposed to quantify various facets of flexibility; this paper reviews and classifies them depending on the question they attempt to address. We propose a pair of novel tools to quantify a comparatively unexplored aspect of flexibility: who is providing it. These frequency spectrum analysis based tools separately quantify flexibility provision on the annual, weekly and daily timescales. The tools’ effectiveness and versatility is demonstrated through several example applications, analysing both historical and prospective power systems, in several geographical locations with contrasting characteristics. The proposed tools are of particular value to the capacity expansion planner, allowing them to quantify changes in flexibility provision as new solutions are introduced, or as carbon taxes, generation and interconnector capacities evolve.},

  abstract = {In the past, power system planning was based on meeting the load duration curve at minimum cost. The increasing share of variable generation (VG) makes operational constraints more important in the planning problem, and there is more and more interest in considering aspects such as sufficient ramping capability, sufficient reserve procurement, power system stability, storage behavior, and the integration of other energy sectors often through demand response assets. In VG integration studies, several methods have been applied to combine the planning and operational timescales. We present a four-level categorization for the modeling methods, in order of increasing complexity: (1a) investment model only, (1b) operational model only, (2) unidirectionally soft-linked investment and operational models, (3a) bidirectionally soft-linked investment and operational models, (3b) operational model with an investment update algorithm, and (4) co-optimization of investments and operation. The review shows that using a low temporal resolution or only few representative days will not suffice in order to determine the optimal generation portfolio. In addition, considering operational effects proves to be important in order to get a more optimal generation portfolio and more realistic estimations of system costs. However, operational details appear to be less significant than the temporal representation. Furthermore, the benefits and impacts of more advanced modeling techniques on the resulting generation capacity mix significantly depend on the system properties. Thus, the choice of the model should depend on the purpose of the study as well as on system characteristics.

We find a wide range of costs across the literature that depend largely on the price and availability of flexible system operation. Costs are small at low penetrations of VRE and can even be negative. Data are scarce at high penetrations, but show that the range widens. Nonetheless, VRE sources can be a key part of a least-cost route to decarbonization.},

The classification considers the time horizon the methods are applicable to, i.e., offline post mortem, online real time and forecasting methods, and the scope of the inertia estimation, e.g., system-wide, regional, generation, demand, individual resource. Shortcomings of the existing inertia estimation methods have been identified and suggestions for future work have been made.},

The need for this tends to be increased by the use of variable renewable energy sources (VRE) such as wind and solar power.

The paper reviews the literature, provides stylized facts from German market data, and suggests policy options. Surprisingly, while German wind and solar capacity has tripled since 2008, balancing reserves have been reduced by 15\%, and costs by 50\%.},

A review of the transition in the electricity system provides a foundation and framework for an agenda for action, primarily at the Federal level.

Many seemingly innocuous decisions appear isolated and limited, but on closer inspection are fundamentally incompatible with and undermine the larger framework. A workable regulatory and market framework is an essential tool for anticipating unintended consequences and acting in time. Introduction},

This paper presents methods used in recent wind integration analyses and operating practice, with key results that compare different methods or data. Wind integration analysis over the past several years has shown that wind variability need not be seen as a contingency event. The impact of wind will be seen in the reserves for non-event operation (normal operation dealing with deviations from schedules). Wind power will also result in some events of larger variability and large forecast errors that could be categorized as slow events. The level of operating reserve that is induced by wind is not constant during all hours of the year, so that dynamic allocation of reserves will reduce the amount of reserves needed in the system for most hours. The paper concludes with recent emerging trends. © 2013 IEEE.},

One approach, called PAMI, extends a relatively unknown pivoting strategy called suboptimization and exploits parallelism across multiple iterations. The other, called SIP, exploits purely single iteration parallelism by overlapping computational components when possible. Computational results show that the performance of PAMI is superior to that of the leading open-source simplex solver, and that SIP complements PAMI in achieving speedup when PAMI results in slowdown. One of the authors has implemented the techniques underlying PAMI within the FICO Xpress simplex solver and this paper presents computational results demonstrating their value. In developing the first parallel revised simplex solver of general utility, this work represents a significant achievement in computational optimization.},

However, there are various, sometimes contradictory, conclusions about the performance of these restructured electricity markets. Market performance depends largely on how each market participant responds to the market design — including market rules, market operational procedures, and information revelation. In this paper, we identify and examine the strategies adopted by generators in Australia's National Electricity Market, based on publicly available data for the period from May 1, 2002 to May 31, 2003. We try to understand and answer some basic questions like how generators respond collectively or individually to changes in market conditions (e.g. load changes) and why they behave in this way. The statistics calculated from the data show that wide variations in the frequency of strategic bidding and rebidding exist; that generators more frequently use capacity offers as a strategic tool than price offers; that large generating units are more likely to use capacity strategies to control market prices; and that generators are capable of responding to changes in market conditions.},

In many regions of the United States, thermal power plants provide a large fraction of the operating reserve requirement. Alternative sources of operating reserves, such as demand response and energy storage, may provide more efficient sources of these reserves. However, to estimate the potential value of these services, the cost of reserve services under various grid conditions must first be established. This analysis used a commercial grid simulation tool to evaluate the cost and price of several operating reserve services, including spinning contingency reserves and upward regulation reserves. These reserve products were evaluated in a utility system in the western United States, considering different system flexibilities, renewable energy penetration, and other sensitivities. The analysis demonstrates that the price of operating reserves depend highly on many assumptions regarding the operational flexibility of the generation fleet, including ramp rates and the fraction of fleet available to provide reserves.},

The new method and management requirements to provide flexibility have emerged from the trend towards power systems increasing renewable energy penetration with generation uncertainty and availability. In this study, the historical development of power system flexibility concept, the flexible power system characteristics, flexibility sources, and evaluation parameters are presented as part of international literature. The impact of variable renewable energy sources penetration on power system transient stability, small-signal stability, and frequency stability are discussed; the studies are presented to the researchers for further studies. Moreover, flexibility measurement studies are investigated, and methods of providing flexibility are evaluated.},

  abstract = {As power systems around the world transform, power system flexibility has become a global priority. A range of operational, policy and investment-based interventions are available to render modern systems more flexible, thereby facilitating cleaner, and more reliable, more resilient, and more affordable energy. This report identifies challenges and opportunities to unlock system flexibility and accelerate power system transformation (PST) efforts. It provides an overview of the policy, regulatory and market instruments which can be implemented in different power sector contexts to mitigate these challenges. Importantly, all power system assets, including variable renewable energy, can provide flexibility services, if enabled by proper policy, market and regulatory frameworks. These assets include power plants, electricity networks, energy storage and distributed energy resources. A wealth of known strategies, approaches and instruments can be readily applied and adapted to power systems. These include modifications to: energy strategies; legal frameworks; policies and programmes; regulatory frameworks; market rules; system operation protocols; and connection codes. Moving forward, updating system flexibility policies to match the pace of technological development can help to accelerate global PST, while ensuring that all classes of power system assets are able to receive fair remuneration for the flexibility services they are capable of providing.},

Thereafter it examines the methods by which ancillary services are procured by highlighting the procurement practices at a number of different Independent System Operators, principally those in California, New York, New England, Texas and the PJM Interconnection, in an attempt to tease out the remaining reasons why the ancillary service markets are still so different. This is important as there are many innovations that are not rooted in regional differences but reflect genuine technical advances and economic efficiency gains and can be replicated across other ISOs to produce more efficient designs, greater reliability and lower costs. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Virtual oscillator control (VOC) is a decentralized control strategy for islanded microgrids where inverters are regulated to emulate the dynamics of weakly nonlinear oscillators. Compared to droop control, which is only well defined in sinusoidal steady state, VOC is a time-domain controller that enables interconnected inverters to stabilize arbitrary initial conditions to a synchronized sinusoidal limit cycle. However, the nonlinear oscillators that are elemental to VOC cannot be designed with conventional linear-control design methods. We address this challenge by applying averaging-and perturbation-based nonlinear analysis methods to extract the sinusoidal steady-state and harmonic behavior of such oscillators. The averaged models reveal conclusive links between real-and reactive-power outputs and the terminal-voltage dynamics. Similarly, the perturbation methods aid in quantifying higher order harmonics. The resultant models are then leveraged to formulate a design procedure for VOC such that the inverter satisfies standard ac performance specifications related to voltage regulation, frequency regulation, dynamic response, and harmonic content. Experimental results for a single-phase 750 VA, 120 V laboratory prototype demonstrate the validity of the design approach. They also demonstrate that droop laws are, in fact, embedded within the equilibria of the nonlinear-oscillator dynamics. This establishes the backward compatibility of VOC in that, while acting on time-domain waveforms, it subsumes droop control in sinusoidal steady state.},

  abstract = {High penetrations of non-synchronous renewable energy generation can decrease overall grid stability because these units do not provide rotational inertia in the same way as traditional synchronously-connected generators. Many recent studies have investigated 100\% renewable energy generation scenarios, but few have explored the trade-offs associated with an electricity grid dominated by non-synchronous generation (i.e. wind and solar). Fast frequency response from grid-forming inverters—along with other technology changes—could help mitigate low system inertia levels, but the impact of this response is unknown. An inertia-constrained unit commitment and dispatch model was used to study the stability of future grid scenarios with high penetrations of non-synchronous renewable energy generation under a variety of technology scenarios. The Texas grid (the Electric Reliability Council of Texas – ERCOT) was used as a test case and instances when the system inertia fell below 100 GW·s (the grid's current minimum level) were recorded. When the modeled critical inertia limit was reduced to 80 GW·s to represent changes in grid operation, no critical inertia hours occurred for renewable energy penetrations up to 93\% of annual energy. The critical inertia limit could drop to 60 GW·s if the largest generators in ERCOT (two co-located nuclear plants) were retired, but emissions increased by \textasciitilde 25\% in these scenarios. If the critical inertia limit was kept the same (100 GW·s), adding 525 MW of fast frequency response from wind, solar, and energy storage could reduce the number of critical inertia hours by up to 95\%. These results show that changes to grid operating practices and generator retirements reduced critical inertia hours more than fast frequency response from inverter-connected resources. Each of these mitigation pathways has associated trade-offs, so the transition to a grid dominated by non-synchronous energy generation should be handled with care, but high renewable energy penetrations (i.e. {$>$}80\%) might be feasible in Texas.},

  abstract = {The supply of intermittent wind and solar generation with zero marginal operating cost is increasingly rapidly in the US. These changes are creating challenges for wholesale markets in two dimensions. Short-term energy and ancillary services markets, built upon mid-twentieth century models of optimal pricing and investment, which now work reasonably well, must accommodate the supply variability and energy market price impacts associated with intermittent generation at scale. These developments raise more profound questions about whether the current market designs can be adapted to provide good long-term price signals to support investment in an efficient portfolio of generating capacity and storage consistent with public policy goals. The recent experience of the California ISO (CAISO) is used to illustrate the impact of intermittent generation on supply patterns, supply variability, and market-based energy prices. Reforms in capacity markets and scarcity pricing mechanisms are needed if policy-makers seek to adapt the traditional wholesale market designs to accommodate intermittent generation at scale. However, if the rapid growth of integrated resource planning, subsidies for some technologies but not others, mandated long term contracts, and other expansions of state regulation continue, more fundamental changes are likely to be required in the institutions that determine generator and storage entry and exit decisions.},

Many electricity sectors are now pursuing deep decarbonization goals which will entail replacing dispatchable fossil generation primarily with intermittent renewable generation (wind and solar) over the next 20–30 years. This transition creates new challenges for both short-term wholesale market design and investment incentives consistent with achieving both decarbonization commitments and security of supply criteria. Thinking broadly about the options for institutional change from a Williamsonian perspective – thinking like Williamson – provides a useful framework for examining institutional adaptation. Hybrid markets that combine ‘competition for the market’ that relies on competitive procurement for long-term purchased power agreements with wind, solar, and storage developers, ideally in a technology neutral fashion, and ‘competition in the market’ that relies on short-term markets designed to produce efficient and reliable operations of intermittent generation and storage, is identified as a promising direction for institutional adaptation. Many auction, contract, and market integration issues remain to be resolved.},

We then examine the assumptions required for competitive electricity markets to achieve this optimal price and investment program and the implications of relaxing several of these assumptions. We analyze the interrelationships between regulator-imposed wholesale market price caps and generating capacity obligations. The implications of potential network collapses for operating reserve requirements and whether market prices yield generation investments consistent with these reserve requirements are examined.},

  abstract = {Global and regional trends indicate that energy demand will soon be covered by a widespread deployment of renewable energy sources. However, the weather and climate driven energy sources are characterized by a significant spatial and temporal variability. One of the commonly mentioned solutions to overcome the mismatch between demand and supply provided by renewable generation is a hybridization of two or more energy sources into a single power station (like wind-solar, solar-hydro or solar-wind-hydro). The operation of hybrid energy sources is based on the complementary nature of renewable sources. Considering the growing importance of such systems and increasing number of research activities in this area this paper presents a comprehensive review of studies which investigated, analyzed, quantified and utilized the effect of temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal complementarity between renewable energy sources. The review starts with a brief overview of available research papers, formulates detailed definition of major concepts, summarizes current research directions and ends with prospective future research activities. The review provides a chronological and spatial information with regard to the studies on the complementarity concept.},

In this study, we propose a simple but feasible method to estimate the grid flexibility on a national scale, using available datasets. The method is demonstrated to assess the grid flexibility in Japanese power plants under different operating conditions. In addition, we evaluate the environmental impacts of photovoltaic (PV) and wind power within their capacity limits. The grid flexibility increases from 50 GW to 82 GW, the capacity limit of PV increases from 63 GW to 102 GW, and that of wind power increases from 37 GW to 76 GW, by the suspension of nuclear power plants and the load-following operation of coal-fired power plants. The annual CO2 reductions achieved by PV and wind power generation represent less than 10\% of the total CO2 emissions in Japan. Depending on the operating conditions, the capacity limit of PVs may exceed when connecting to a permitted PV power source to the grid.},

A conceptual analysis of relevant drivers, such as increasing distributed energy resources (DER; primarily rooftop PV), decreasing EES cost, and expected benefits are assessed in a case study using annual sample data from a distribution network in eastern New South Wales, Australia. The study finds that shared EES located in the LV network, if joint revenue from PV customers, distribution network and energy trading companies is captured, can become NPV positive in 2023 and bring additional benefits to a range of stakeholders. A 500 kWh battery located next to a transformer and mitigating up to 30\% overload is found to be optimal. However, multiple regulatory challenges need to be overcome to enable shared usage of EES in vertically disintegrated energy sectors.},

A GIS-supported hourly simulation study of Australia assesses the impact of adding EES to wind and solar generation on levelised cost of electricity (LCOE), installed capacity, generation mix and energy spillage. The study finds that EES deployment is able to lower LCOE in scenarios with high penetration of renewable sources. In the case study of Australia, it is found that EES between 90 and 180 GWh capacity can be economic for cost levels below 1,000 AU\$ kWhÀ1. In addition, the study finds that EES can reduce LCOE by 13e22\%, reduce installed capacity by up to 22\%, and reduce spilled energy by up to 76\%. It is shown that the generation mix is highly influenced by the magnitude of EES deployed.},

Such science and technology, and their integration into markets, are critical for shaping behavior and extending discipline over carbon consumption and excessive risk-taking. There is thus a technology arms race among climate services providers to develop capacity for understanding market, transition, and physical risks across a broad spectrum of asset classes. But the lack of transparent scientific validation and public oversight over rapidly advancing, and often proprietary, “black box” technologies are causes of concern, both for the integrity of science and for the potential impacts on consumer behavior and public policy. This paper explores potential pathways for public-sector consumers to extend review authority over such products and services that may be operating outside of the bounds of scientific merit, to balance demands for public transparency, scientific integrity, intellectual property, and commercial enterprise in the broader adaptation of market economies.},

This is because economists made their own predictions of damages, using three spurious methods: assuming that about 90\% of GDP will be unaffected by climate change, because it happens indoors; using the relationship between temperature and GDP today as a proxy for the impact of global warming over time; and using surveys that diluted extreme warnings from scientists with optimistic expectations from economists. Nordhaus has misrepresented the scientific literature to justify the using a smooth function to describe the damage to GDP from climate change. Correcting for these errors makes it feasible that the economic damages from climate change are at least an order of magnitude worse than forecast by economists, and may be so great as to threaten the survival of human civilization.},

Currently, inverter-based DER contribute very little to the power balance on all but a few utility distribution systems. A significant increase in DER is expected to come on line in the near future. As the penetration level of DER increases, the effect of DER may no longer be considered minimal. As DER become prevalent in the distribution system, equipment rating capability and coordination of protection systems merit a closer investigation.

  abstract = {As power system renewable energy penetrations increase, the ways in which key renewable technologies such as wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) differ from thermal generators become more apparent. Many studies have examined the variability and uncertainty of such generators and described how generation and load can be balanced for a wide variety of annual energy penetrations, at timescales from seconds to years. Another important characteristic of these resources is asynchronicity, the result of using inverters to interface the prime energy source with the power system as opposed to synchronous generators. Unlike synchronous generators, whose frequency of alternating current (AC) injection is physically coupled to the rotation of the machine itself, inverter based asynchronous generators do not share the same physical coupling with the generated frequency. These subtle differences impact the operations of power systems developed around the characteristics of synchronous generators. In this paper we review current knowledge and open research questions concerning the interplay between asynchronous inverter-based resources (IBRs) and cycle- to second-scale power system dynamics, with a focus on how stability and control may be impacted or need to be achieved differently when there are high instantaneous penetrations of IBRs across an interconnection. This work does not seek to provide a comprehensive review of the latest developments, but is instead intended to be accessible to any reader with an engineering background and an interest in power systems and renewable energy. As such, the paper includes basic material on power electronics, control schemes for IBRs, and power system stability; and uses this background material to describe potential impacts of IBRs on power system stability, operational challenges associated with large amounts of distributed IBR generation, and modern power system simulation trends driven by IBR characteristics.},

Based on the instructive example of the evolution of European electricity market designs, we discuss several shortcomings of energy-only markets and illustrate how ad-hoc policies that intend to address them have limitations of their own, notably a lack of systemwide coordination. Second, we describe how the sheer scale and nature of deep decarbonization targets requiring massive investment in capital-intensive low-carbon technologies exacerbate these issues. Ambitious emission reduction targets thus require an evolution of market design towards hybrid regimes. Hybrid markets separate long-term investment decisions from short-term operations through a balanced and differentiated use of competitive and regulatory design elements to coordinate and de-risk investment. Finally, a historical analysis of the evolution of different electricity market designs shows how hybrid markets constitute contemporary forms of long-run marginal cost pricing that are appropriate for meeting deep decarbonization targets with reduced uncertainty and hence lower private and social costs.},

An accurate battery degradation cost function is integrated into the BESS’s strategic bidding model. An automatic generation control (AGC) signal dispatch model is proposed to deploy AGC signals in the bi-level framework. This enables thorough studies for BESS’s operating characteristics in the frequency regulation market, when both battery degradation and detailed AGC signal following activities are considered. Case studies on a synthetic system with real-world data are performed to study interactions between BESS profit maximization and wholesale market operations, considering system annual load and ancillary service requirements variations. The impacts of BESS capacity and replacement cost on its revenue from energy and ancillary services markets are also investigated.},

The optimal use of such storage when facing Time of Use (ToU) prices is directly related to the quality of the load and generation forecasts as well as the algorithm that controls the battery. The sensitivity of such control to different forecast techniques is studied in this paper. It is shown that good and bad forecasts can result in losses in, particularly bad days. Nevertheless, it is observed that performing Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a simple forecast that is representative of the pasts can be profitable under different price and battery scenarios. We observe that performing MPC at a faster sampling time with a receding optimization horizon makes arbitrage less sensitive to uncertainties in forecasting. We use real data from Pecan Street and ToU price levels with different buying and selling price for the numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {The anticipated increase in variable generation in the Western Interconnection (WI) over the next several years has raised concerns about how to maintain system balance, especially in smaller Balancing Areas (BAs). Given renewable portfolio standards in the West, it is possible that more than 50 gigawatts (GW) of wind capacity will be installed by 2020. Significant quantities of solar generation are likely to be added as well. The consequent increase in variability and uncertainty that must be managed by the conventional generation fleet and responsive load make it attractive to consider ways in which Balancing Area Authorities (BAAs) can pool their variability and response resources, thus taking advantage of geographic and temporal diversity to increase overall operational efficiency. Our analysis considers several alternative forms of an Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) that have been proposed in the non-market areas of the WI. The proposed EIM includes two changes in operating practices that independently reduce variability and increase access to responsive resources: BAA cooperation and sub-hourly dispatch. As proposed, the EIM does not consider any form of coordinated unit commitment; however, over time it is possible that BAAs would develop formal or informal coordination plans. This report examines the benefits of several possible EIM implementations, both separately and in concert.},

We additionally provide publicly available reference implementations of all formulations examined. We computationally test existing and novel UC formulations on a suite of instances drawn from both academic and real-world data sources. Driven by our computational experience from this and previous work, we contribute some additional formulations for both generator production upper bounds and piecewise linear production costs. By composing new UC formulations using existing components found in the literature and new components introduced in this paper, we demonstrate that performance can be significantly improved—and in the process, we identify a new state-of-the-art UC formulation.},

In general, the instant balance of temporal and spatial inequalities of the electricity system can be achieved by many compensating measures. However, a thorough and precise quantification of the flexibility demand of a VRE based energy system turns out to be a complex task. So far, literature on energy economics and engineering has provided analyses concerning various aspects of the system requirements for flexibility. Accordingly, this review paper primarily aims to categorize the scientific approaches that have been used in “flexibility demand” studies. In this context, we classify exemplary study results from the German and European energy systems into technical, economic, and market potential categories to enhance their comparability. Moreover, we conduct a methodological evaluation of the literature findings to determine further research requirements. Against this background we also discuss a conceptual framework to quantify the market potential of flexible technologies.},

With increasing penetration of renewable resources, it is important that this balancing is done effectively, considering the high uncertainty of wind and solar energy. Storing electrical energy can make the grid more reliable and efficient and energy storage is proposed as a complement to highly variable renewable energy sources. However, for investments in energy storage to increase, participating in the market must become economically viable for owners. This paper proposes a stochastic formulation of a storage owner's arbitrage profit maximization problem under uncertainty in day-ahead and real-time market prices. The proposed model helps storage owners in market bidding and operational decisions and in estimation of the economic viability of energy storage. Case study results on realistic market price data show that the novel stochastic bidding approach does significantly better than the deterministic benchmark.},

  abstract = {Reliable and secure operation of a power system depends on the ability of system operation to address system imbalances on account of demand-supply imbalances and that an account of change in availability of transmission network elements. The impact of a power plant or transmission line failures causes a short-term imbalance between generation and demand, and balance can be addressed by deploying flexible reserves and ancillary services. The system imbalances in the Indian power system operation are addressed through Deviation Settlement Mechanism, a commercial mechanism based on a frequency linked incentive/penalty structure. Implementation of reserve regulation ancillary services in India has further helped to address deviation in frequency, congestion, and to bring grid resilience. This paper discusses the development of ancillary services in India, alongside crucial developments in the power market. Given the ongoing developments in the Indian power market and international experiences, this paper suggests a road map for further development of the ancillary services market in the country. The Indian power system has also witnessed a significant growth of variable renewable energy resources. In the future, renewable resources are expected to provide full range ancillary services ensuring the least cost, supply security, and high availability of reserves. Deviations on account of uncertainty associated with renewable resource generation are also subject to Deviation Settlement Mechanism, although with lenient penalties.},

People with an organizational mandate; Assignment to tasks that are important and complex; Use of communications technology for interaction and decision making; Role in multinational organizations.ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Global virtual teams are internationally distributed groups of people with an organizational mandate to make or implement decisions with international components and implications. They are typically assigned tasks that are strategically important and highly complex. They rarely meet in person, conducting almost all of their interaction and decision making using communications technology. Although they play an increasingly important role in multinational organizations, little systematic is known about their dynamics or effectiveness. This study built a grounded theory of global virtual team processes and performance over time. We built a template based on Adaptive Structuration Theory (DeSanctis and Poole 1994) to guide our re- search, and we conducted a case study, observing three global virtual teams over a period of 21 months. Data were gathered using multiple methods, and qualitative methods were used to analyze them and generate a theory of global virtual team dynamics and effectiveness. First, we propose that effective global virtual team interaction comprises a series of communication incidents, each configured by aspects of the team's structural and process elements. Effective outcomes were associated with a fit among an interaction incident's form, decision process, and complexity. Second, effective global virtual teams sequence these incidents to generate a deep rhythm of regular face-to- face incidents interspersed with less intensive, shorter incidents using various media. These two insights are discussed with respect to other literature and are elaborated upon in several propositions. Implications for research and practice are also out- lined. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The latter are often compared using unique, not publicly available datasets and across too short and limited to one market test samples. The proposed new methods are rarely benchmarked against well established and well performing simpler models, the accuracy metrics are sometimes inadequate and testing the significance of differences in predictive performance is seldom conducted. Consequently, it is not clear which methods perform well nor what are the best practices when forecasting electricity prices. In this paper, we tackle these issues by comparing state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning methods across multiple years and markets, and by putting forward a set of best practices. In addition, we make available the considered datasets, forecasts of the state-of-the-art models, and a specifically designed python toolbox, so that new algorithms can be rigorously evaluated in future studies.},

  abstract = {To correct grid imbalances and avoid grid failures, the transmission system operator (TSO) deploys balancing reserves and settles these imbalances by penalizing the market actors that caused them. In several countries, it is forbidden to influence the grid imbalances in order to let the TSO retain full control of grid regulation. In this paper, we argue that this approach is not optimal as market actors that trade imbalances under the supervision of the TSO can help balancing the grid more efficiently. For instance, some systems such as solar farms cannot participate in the standard balancing market but do have economic incentives to help regulate the grid by trading with imbalances. Based on this argument, we propose a new market framework where any market actor is allowed to trade with imbalances. We show that, using the new market mechanism, the TSO can keep full control of the grid balance while decreasing the balancing cost. This is of primary importance as: 1) novel approaches to reduce grid imbalances are needed as, while renewable sources are generally not used for grid balancing, the increasing integration of renewable energy sources creates higher imbalances. 2) While long-term storage of energy is key in the energy transition, it needs to become an attractive investment to ensure its widespread use; as we show, the proposed market can guarantee that. Based on a real case study, we show that the new market can provide 10–20\% of the total balancing energy needed and reduce the balancing costs.},

  abstract = {As the penetration of variable renewable generation increases in power systems worldwide, planning for the effects of variability will become more important. Traditional capacity adequacy planning techniques have been supplemented with integration studies, which have been carried out in power systems with high targets for renewable generation. These have highlighted the increased variability that a system may experience in the future. As system generation planning techniques evolve with the challenge of integrating variable generation, the flexibility of a system to manage periods of high variability needs to be assessed. The insufficient ramping resource expectation (IRRE) metric is proposed to measure power system flexibility for use in long-term planning, and is derived from traditional generation adequacy metrics. Compared to existing generation adequacy metrics, flexibility assessment is more data intensive. A flexibility metric can identify the time intervals over which a system is most likely to face a shortage of flexible resources, and can measure the relative impact of changing operational policies and the addition of flexible resources. The flexibility of a test system with increasing penetrations of variable generation is assessed. The results highlight the time horizons of increased and decreased risk associated with the integration of VG. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {As the penetration of variable renewable generation increases in power systems worldwide, planning for the effects of variability will become more important. Traditional capacity adequacy planning techniques have been supplemented with integration studies, which have been carried out in power systems with high targets for renewable generation. These have highlighted the increased variability that a system may experience in the future. As system planning techniques evolve with the demands from variable generation, the flexibility of a system to manage periods of high variability will need to be assessed. A metric may be required to measure the flexibility of a power system for use in planning studies with multi-year horizons. Compared to generation adequacy metrics, system flexibility assessment is more data intensive and requires more detailed system modeling. An algorithm for scenario development in generation planning with high penetrations of variable generation is presented. © 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Long-term transmission and generation planning face numerous challenges to accommodate the integration of a high penetration of variable generation (VG). System flexibility, or the ability of a system to meet changes in demand and VG production, is one such issue receiving much attention. This paper presents a methodology to assess the flexibility of a power system while explicitly considering the limitations of the transmission network. By determining only the flexibility available from resources which could be realized in real-time operation due to transmission constraints, a more realistic assessment of a system's flexibility can be made. The flexibility of the IEEE Reliability Test System is assessed using two metrics. Transmission is shown to have a significant effect on the availability of flexibility and the risk posed to the system by net load ramps. The impact is seen to be strongly dependent on the variability of the net load and on the distribution of online resources. A nonlinear relationship between the installed VG and system flexibility is found, with regions of significant inflexibility occurring at certain VG penetrations.},

  abstract = {Increasing inverter-based sources reduces the system's inertia resulting in possible frequency stability issues. Understanding low-inertia systems and their stability properties is of crucial importance. This article introduces fundamental ways to integrate high levels of renewable energy (RE) and distributed energy resources (DERs) in the power system while creating a more flexible power system. Using RE and DER in the distribution system has many advantages such as reducing the physical and electrical distance between generation and loads, bringing sources closer to loads contributes to the enhancement of the voltage profile, reduction in distribution and transmission bottlenecks, improved reliability, lower losses, and enhances the potential use of waste heat. A basic issue for high penetration of DER is the technical complexity of controlling hundreds of thousands to millions of inverters. This is addressed through autonomous techniques using local measurements eliminating the need for fast control systems. The key issues addressed in this article include using inverter damping to stabilize frequency in systems with low or no inertia, autonomous operation, methods for relieving inverter overload, energy reserves, and their implementation in photovoltaics (PV) systems. This article provides important insight into the interactions between inverter bases sources and the high-power system. The distinction between grid-forming (GFM) inverter and grid-following (GFL) inverter is profound. GFM inverters provide damping to frequency swings in a mixed system, while GFL inverter can aggravate frequency problems with increased penetration. Rather than acting as a source of inertia, the GFM inverter acts as a source of damping to the system. On the other hand, the application of inverters in the power system has two major issues. One is the complexity of controlling hundreds of thousands to millions of inverters. This is addressed through autonomous techniques using local measurements. The other is the potential of high overcurrent in GFM inverters and techniques for explicitly protecting against overloading. To exploit the innate damping of GFM inverters, energy reserves are critical.},

  abstract = {In Chapter 6 we described a number of different ways of constructing a policy. One of the most important ways, and the way that is most widely associated with the term " approximate dynamic programming, " requires approximating the value of being in a state. Chapter 8 described a number of different approximation strategies, including lookup table, aggregated functions, parametric models and nonparametric models. All of these statistical models are created by generating a state S n , next computing some observation of a valuê v n of being in state S n , and finally using the pair (S n v n) to estimate (or update the estimate) of the value of being in a state. In this chapter we focus primarily on the different ways of calculatin v n and then use this information to estimate a value function approximation, for a fixed policy. To emphasize that we are computing values for a fixed policy, we index parameters such as the value function V π by the policy π . After we establish the fundamentals for estimating the value of a policy, we address in Chapter 10 the last step of searching for good policies. 9.1 SAMPLING THE VALUE OF A POLICY At first glance the problem of statistically estimating the value of a fixed policy should not be any different than estimating a function from noisy observations. We start by showing that from one perspective this is correct. However, the context of dynamic programming, even when we fix a policy, introduces opportunities and challenges as we realize that we can take advantage of the dynamics of information that may arise in both finite and infinite horizon settings.},

All patients had successful previous surgery for complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and complete panretinal photocoagulation performed. All patients had sudden visual deterioration and fluorescein angiography confirmed central retinal artery occlusion. Prominent cherry-red spot was noted in only two eyes. The other eyes either had less prominent or incomplete, or invisible cherry-red spots. Sequential optical coherence tomography in 7 of the 12 eyes showed increased optical reflectivity at inner retinal layer in 6 of the 7 eyes. Rubeosis iridis developed later in six eyes and neovascular glaucoma in four eyes. Vision worsening was noted in five eyes, improved in three eyes, and stable in four eyes after an averaged follow-up of 4 months.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Less typical cherry-red spots, higher possibility of rubeosis despite previous complete panretinal photocoagulation, are the characteristic features of central retinal artery occlusion in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy with previous vitrectomy.},

For this roadmap, we focus on a specific family of grid-forming inverter control approaches that do not rely on an external voltage source (i.e., no phase-locked loop) and that can share load without explicit communications. Although the roadmap is focused narrowly on system challenges for grid-forming controls and power system stability, including interactions with protection, we hope it serves as a foundational element for future system-of-systems roadmapping needed in a broader grid modernization effort with increasing deployments of inverter-based resources.},

  abstract = {Many existing technical feasibility and modelling studies in the energy field are criticised for their limited treatment of societal actors and socio-political dynamics, poor representation of the co-evolving nature of society and technology, and hence an inability to analyse socio-technical change. At the same time, prominent conceptual frameworks of socio-technical transitions that address these elements are often found to be difficult to operationalize in quantitative energy analyses that meet policy development requirements. However a new energy modelling paradigm has started to emerge for integrating both quantitative modelling and conceptual sociotechnical transitions. This paper provides a taxonomy for this new model category: ‘socio-technical energy transition’ (STET) models. A review of existing STET models and their applications to the energy supply, buildings and transport sectors is provided. Following this review, the paper reflects on the extent to which these existing quantitative models captured the variety of factors covered in socio-technical transitions theory, highlights the challenges associated with their theoretical and behavioural validation, and proposes future development priorities for STET models.},

  abstract = {New projects using existing storage technologies such as Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) face uncertainty due to the lack of clear business models. Market regimes have generally tended to embed storage and generators within the central management of operators with multiple assets such as the French EdF (Electricit´e de France). By means of back-casting, this study depicts the role of storage in the power market, within the vertical integration in the governance portfolio of EdF. A dynamic algorithm simulates hourly operation under two different storage strategies, daily and weekly, and the results are compared with actual patterns over the period 2015–2019. This reveals missing money for a stand-alone player due to price arbitrage caused by low spread, and missing market opportunities. This suggests that the economics of storage are not driven by spot prices alone, but by other services, such as the energy block provision in support of nuclear power. Differential calculus is used to estimate the value of flows integrating the duration of storage and its seasonality. These findings further support the French regulator to install new PHS despite the lack of profitability, by means of capacity-energy hybrid con­ tracts for new competitors in place of the existing government-industry structure.},

A framework is presented that allows policy makers to accurately assess these services. Furthermore, the role of the service aggregator in the provision from prosumers is outlined, something that highlights the value of the new distributed framework. Also discussed are the key features within the overall context of the design variables in various European countries, which are representative of different synchronous areas. This finding implies that from a regulatory point of view, important efforts are being made to harmonise the different network codes in the investigated countries. Moreover, this research compares the impact of techno-economic design variables on the financial incomes of providing frequency control services. For this purpose, we used a stochastic model of input variables that involves the statistical analysis of time series. A probabilistic method based on Monte Carlo simulation allowed the assessment of the revenues. The outcomes indicate that the RES penetration in each country together with the ratios of the power availability band and of the power availability band activation, and their associated prices are crucial factors that influence the resulting profitability.},

Along with the climate goals of the Paris Agreement, the national greenhouse gas strategies of industrialized countries involve the total restructuring of their energy systems. In order to archive these climate goals, fitted and customized models are required. For that reason, this paper focuses on national energy system models that incorporate all energy sectors and can support governmental decision making processes. The reviewed models are evaluated in terms of their characteristics, like their underlying methodology, analytical approach, time horizon and transformation path analysis, spatial and temporal resolution, licensing and modeling language. These attributes are set in the context of the region and time in which they were developed in order to identify trends in modeling. Furthermore, the revealed trends are set in the context of current challenges in energy systems modeling. Combining specified research questions and specific greenhouse gas reduction strategies, this paper will help researchers and decision makers find appropriate energy system models.},

The uncertainties over the multiple stages are characterized by a scenario tree and the optimal dispatch scheme is cast as a decision tree which guarantees the flexibility to decide the reasonable outputs of generation and the adequate reserves accounting for different realizations of renewable energy. Most importantly, to deal with the 'Curse of Dimensionality' of stochastic programming, stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) is employed, which decomposes the original problem into several sub-problems according to the stages. Specifically, the SDDP algorithm performs forward pass and backward pass repeatedly until the convergence criterion is satisfied. At each iteration, the original problem is approximated by creating a linear piecewise function. Besides, an improved convergence criterion is adopted to narrow the optimization gaps. The results on the IEEE 118-bus system and real-life provincial power grid show the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.},

It has delivered reliable electricity supply with apparent economic efficiency gains over the former monopoly utility arrangements, and in the context of significant industry challenges including peak demand growth and a changing generation mix. However, to date it has largely failed in reducing greenhouse emissions although this was an explicit target of public policy when restructuring initially commenced. This chapter explores the reasons for this divergent performance and possible options to address it. While commonly ascribed to a lack of political will, restructuring itself has also created difficulties for effective climate action through a narrow economic focus that resulted in: the creation of large politically powerful market incumbents opposed in many cases to improved environmental outcomes, retail market arrangements encouraging competition in energy sales rather than in efficient provision of desired energy services, and poor governance of external climate policies. There are also more fundamental challenges with the current market framework that will need to be addressed for low-carbon industry transformation. ©2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we consider lessons from the NEM for end-to-end market design that delivers a secure, affordable and clean energy future. We identify seven key challenges: 1) End-to-end electricity market design is a ‘markets’ integration challenge so interface design is a key task, 2) it isn't clear where the ends lie in end-to-end market design given that efficient industry outcomes depend critically on fuel supply and consumer markets that lie outside formal electricity industry arrangements, 3) End-to-end market design requires broader policy and regulatory ‘side-to-side’ design, 4) Markets with major externalities are inefficient by design, 5) Technology change and market design can both reveal currently ‘unpriced’ industry costs and benefits, particularly in security services, 6) The key design challenge in end-to-end market design is the market and regulatory interface with energy consumers, and 7) widespread market failure is not an option in the electricity sector – end-to-end market design also requires design of ‘alternative’ frameworks. While we draw on NEM experiences, our framework would seem to have wider relevance to other jurisdictions now seeking to integrate higher renewable penetrations and distributed energy resources.},

But in essence, you cannot entirely predict the future. This article aims at conceptualizing the limits to anticipate the future – or what is often referred as the substitution of risk for uncertainty. In contrast to most theories examining risk and uncertainty, we start from the assumption that there are limits in the substitution of risk for uncertainty and that distinguishing between ontological and epistemic levels of analysis helps clarify such limits. The paper makes two arguments: first, most approaches see no ontological and/or epistemic limit in the substitution of risk for uncertainty; second, the pluralization of science is the only way to cope with limits in substituting risk for uncertainty. This second argument draws on the assumption that accounting for the uncertainty of the future depends on knowledge production processes able to overcome disciplinary boundaries and better include lay and expert knowledge. In times of great concerns regarding mitigation and adaptation to the ecological crisis, we illustrate our arguments with insights from global environmental governance.},

  abstract = {This report has been written by the Melbourne Energy Institute (MEI) at the University of Melbourne in support of the ‘Independent Review into the Future Security of the National Electricity Market’ (the Review) chaired by Dr Alan Finkel AO. The Review has commissioned Jacobs to model a number of emissions reduction policy scenarios. The generation portfolios resulting from five modelling scenarios have then been used as inputs to the University’s assessment of power system security in the National Electricity Market (NEM). Each of these scenarios features generation portfolios with increasing penetration of Variable Renewable Electricity (VRE) sources out to 2050. Such systems may raise security concerns since most VRE technologies do not typically provide the so-called inertia, which has historically been one of the main means of regulating the AC system frequency to (nominally) 50Hz. This report therefore focuses on so-called frequency response adequacy, i.e., assessing whether the dynamic response of a given generation portfolio following a so-called contingency event would be adequate to return the system frequency to 50Hz without disruptions to energy supply. The main contingency event considered in this report is the loss of the largest operating generator in the network, which is standard practice in such studies. The report first defines key terms and concepts, then presents the methodology used to undertake these security assessment studies, and finally presents the relevant results. The work performed includes: 1. Analysis of future power system security under each scenario, and advice on what subsequent actions may be required to establish power system security, if needed; and 2. Analysis of the minimum level of inertia required in the so-called Clean Energy Target and Limited Lifetime (CET\&LL) scenario. Whilst a comprehensive analysis of system security is beyond the scope of this work, these analyses highlight two main points: 1. Without implementation of appropriate operational measures, the NEM will experience increasing issues of frequency control in all modelled scenarios, including the Business As Usual case. 2. There is significant potential to use several operational measures and electricity market designs to ensure frequency response adequacy in VRErich power systems. Such operational measures and market designs could drive the generation portfolio’s operation so that the dynamic response of the system after a potential contingency event is constrained to return the system frequency to 50Hz. Indeed, frequency response adequacy appears achievable in all of the scenarios studied in this report. Furthermore, whilst inertia-bearing generation is likely to remain important, our analyses also show that there are a number of other technologies and services 7 that can provide so-called Fast Frequency Response (FFR) and therefore also legitimately play a significant role in supporting frequency regulation. This includes demand response, energy storage of several forms, and the so-called synthetic inertia in newer wind turbines, amongst others. Other means to increase the system inertia, such as synchronous condensers, could also assist in providing this support. More broadly, numerous technologies and services could provide frequency support given careful electricity market design that does not discriminate unfairly among these technologies and services. This could also include operational services using emerging techniques such as dynamically rescheduling for the current largest contingency and simultaneously scheduling inertia and frequency response. Such approaches may be particularly useful in systems with potentially very low inertia, as might occur in a region of the power system that is at risk of becoming islanded or has become islanded after an interconnector failure. In these cases, specific arrangements for provision of frequency response and system inertia should be made regionally, in addition to simultaneously controlling frequency for the NEM as a whole. Finally, it should be highlighted that frequency stability is not the only important aspect of system security in a future NEM. These other aspects, which were out of the scope of this work, require detailed further study.},

This paper presents novel insights into stability properties of such systems. For that purpose, a high-fidelity dynamic model of a generic low-inertia power system has been developed. The full-order, state-of-the-art control schemes of both synchronous and converter-based generators are included, with the latter differentiating between grid-forming and grid-following mode of operation. Furthermore, the dynamics of transmission lines and loads are captured in the model. Using modal analysis techniques such as participation factors and parameter sensitivity, the most vulnerable segments of the system are determined and the adverse effects of timescale coupling and control interference are investigated. More precisely, this work characterizes the maximum permissible penetration levels of inverter-based generation as well as the nature of the associated unstable modes and the underlying dynamics. Finally, potential directions for improving the system stability margin under different generation portfolios are proposed for several benchmark systems.},

  abstract = {Understanding competition in electricity markets is fundamental to developing good regulatory, market design and associated policy frameworks for the electricity sector. Where and when competition is effective, appropriate market designs can be largely left to run; where it is not, interventions may be needed. Despite the need to monitor competition in electricity markets, there appears to be a gap in the current literature around the competitiveness of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). This means that policymakers and researchers may not have enough information to adequately address the policy needs of Australia's electricity sector. This research applies a number of key measures of competition used by regulators and researchers to the NEM's historical market dataset. Using ten years of bidding and dispatch data, a more complete picture of competition in the NEM has been constructed. This research has identified that common measures of competition may either vastly over or under-estimate levels of competitiveness because they do not account for constrained electricity trading between various regional nodes, as in the NEM. This paper implements a simple solution to this problem, termed the network-extended residual supply index (NERSI), which may present a more accurate predictor of market power for regulators and policymakers.},

  abstract = {In power systems around the world, substantial quantities of Variable Renewable Generation (VRG) sources such as wind and solar are being introduced. Challenges arise from increasing VRG as it is characterised by significant variability, uncertainty and very low short-run costs of production. This thesis investigates the impacts of increasing VRG within electricity markets at the operational and investment time-scales, particularly with respect to resource adequacy and revenue sufficiency. An electricity market model which uses least-cost optimization is first developed. This contains sub-models covering the generation expansion, unit commitment, and economic dispatch time-frames. The model includes a stochastic representation of forecast errors for VRG and demand. It also includes constraints on Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) and inertia. The model produces prices for energy and reserves and FCAS, allowing the assessment of the financial performance of generators. The model is also extended to include sub-hourly unit commitment and dispatch. The thesis then examines the performance of generators in an energy-only market with increasing VRG driven by different policies. In particular, the impact of unit commitment constraints on revenue sufficiency for thermal, renewable and storage technologies is assessed. It is found that the presence of wind up to approximately 40\% of annual energy does not cause significant deviation from the theory of revenue sufficiency via short-run marginal pricing [131,136], provided the fleet is optimal, i.e. all plant has the opportunity to enter or exit the market. However, fleets with solar greater than 20\% of annual energy experience declining financial performance for both solar and thermal generators. The impact of a Rate of Change of Frequency constraint on generator financial performance is also considered. It is found that a 1Hz/s constraint only affects fleets with significant storage capacity, as it is assumed that this technology can contribute to FCAS requirements, but not inertia requirements. A tighter constraint of 0.5Hz/s is also found to impact other fleets which have no storage capacity but significant VRG capacity. How- ever, these fleets already experience declining financial performance for generators as described above. Finally, the impact of the variability of VRG at sub-hourly time-scales on unit commitment and dispatch decisions is investigated. However, this is not found to cause significant cost increases for fleets with either wind or solar up to 60\%},

The integration of large shares of wind generation in power systems led to the development of new forecasting methodologies, including probabilistic forecasting tools, but management tools able to use those forecasts to help making operational decisions are still needed. In this paper, a risk evaluation perspective is used, showing that it is possible to describe the consequences of each possible reserve level through a set of risk indices useful for decision making. The new reserve management tool (RMT) described in the paper is intended to support the SO in defining the operating reserve needs for the daily and intraday markets. Decision strategies like setting an acceptable risk level or finding a compromise between economic issues and the risk of loss of load are explored. An illustrative example based on the Portuguese power system demonstrates the usefulness and efficiency of the tool. © 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In most liberalized electricity markets, flaws in short-term price formation have led to a “missing money” problem wherein average energy prices are too low to support an efficient level of capacity. Recent growth of wind and solar generation has exposed another category of flaws related to intertemporal constraints, such that energy prices are not volatile enough to support an efficient level of flexibility. In theory, electricity markets convey the value of flexibility through time-varying prices, encouraging market participants to invest in resources able to match production and consumption profiles to grid needs. Real-world market clearing procedures, however, make several simplifications that suppress volatility relative to the theoretical ideal. This paper describes five mechanisms by which current wholesale electricity market price formation may fail to provide full-strength incentives for flexible resources. Instead of restoring price volatility, market designers may choose to define flexibility products that act as a proxy for full-strength prices. However, these products cannot replicate theoretically ideal incentives precisely, with potentially important consequences for small-scale and distributed resources. The analysis could help guide ongoing efforts to ensure that systems have the capability to respond to growing variability and uncertainty in an efficient way.},

During an exceptionally cold winter storm in February 2021, ERCOT experienced shortfalls on an unprecedented scale, with nearly half of the generation fleet experiencing outages at the peak. The depth of the resulting blackouts invites questions regarding the ability of systems relying on decentralized planning to appropriately prepare for and withstand rare events. Based on two mild assumptions, risk aversion among investors and incomplete risk trading, this paper provides an explanation for why decentralized markets are prone to underinvestment in resilience. We describe the nature of the incomplete risk trading that arises in the context of electricity markets and discuss potential remedies, including mandatory contracting obligations for retailers and compensation to end users for unserved energy.},

  abstract = {With wind and solar becoming major contributors to electricity production in many systems, wholesale market operators have become increasingly aware of the need to address uncertainty when forming prices. Although implementing theoretically ideal stochastic market clearing to address uncertainty may be impossible, the use of operating reserve demand curves allows market designers to inject an element of stochasticity into deterministic market clearing formulations. The construction of these curves, which alter the procurement of reserves and therefore the pricing of both reserves and energy, relies on contentious administrative parameters that lack strong theoretical justification. This paper proposes instead to link their construction to outcomes that would be expected in efficient stochastic markets. The analysis considers the potential of these “quasi-stochastic” market clearing approaches to improve efficiency relative to the deterministic status quo as well as ways in which they are unable to fully replicate the stochastic ideal. Further, the paper argues that efficiently managing uncertainty entails a reexamination of the discriminatory uplift payments and enhanced pricing schemes currently employed to address nonconvexity.},

  abstract = {Price volatility and increasing renewable energy generation have raised interest in the potential opportunities for storage technologies in energy-only electricity markets. In this paper we explore the value of a price-taking storage device in such a market, the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia. Our analysis suggests that under optimal operation, there is little value in having more than six hours of storage in this market. However, an inability to perfectly forecast wholesale prices, particularly extreme price spikes, may warrant some additional storage. We found that storage devices effectively provide a similar service to peak generators and are similarly dependent on and exposed to extreme price events, with revenue for a merchant generator highly skewed to a few days of the year. As a consequence of this finding, and in contrast to previous studies, the value of storage was found to be relatively insensitive to the round trip efficiency. We also found that the variability of revenue and exposure to extreme prices could be reduced using common hedging strategies, such as those currently used by peak generators. We present a case study that demonstrates storage technologies using such strategies may have a competitive advantage over other peaking generators in the NEM, due to the ability to earn revenue outside of extreme peak events. Similar to traditional peak generators, a main driver for storage options in an energy-only electricity market is extreme prices, which in turn is dependent on capacity requirements. However storage technologies can receive additional revenue streams, which may be improved by increased integration of renewable energy.},

  abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds readers' knowledge of and confidence in statistical modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling. Web Resource The book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},

For example, the recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 841 instructs independent system operators to remove barriers of entry for storage assets. This paper reviews electricity market rules to inform an accurate representation of storage bidding behavior in day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) electricity markets. Storage dispatch strategies are explored using production cost and price-taker models to address two related research questions: (1) will storage assets receive the highest remuneration by bidding into DA markets, bidding into RT markets, or redispatching bids in both markets and (2) how accurate must forecast information be for a redispatch strategy to improve remuneration? Results show that with sufficient ability to forecast prices, redispatching a DA schedule in the RT takes advantage of both markets: a longer dispatch horizon as well as more volatile prices.},

Studies have shown that combined-cycle gas turbines are more vulnerable to an LBO condition during short-circuit events when they operate at rated power output.

  abstract = {Increasing power system stability challenges are being witnessed worldwide, while transitioning toward low-carbon grids with a high-share of power electronic converter (PEC)-interfaced renewable energy sources (RESs) and distributed energy resources (DERs). Concurrently, new technologies and operational strategies are being implemented or proposed to tackle these challenges. Since electricity grids are deregulated in many jurisdictions, such technologies need to be integrated within a market framework, which is often a challenge in itself due to inevitable regulatory delays in updating grid codes and market rules. It is also highly desirable to ensure that an economically feasible optimal technology mix is integrated in the power system, without imposing additional burdens on electricity consumers. This article provides a comprehensive overview of emerging power system stability challenges posed by PEC-interfaced RES and DER, particularly related to low inertia and low system strength conditions, while also introducing new technologies that can help tackle these challenges and discussing the need for suitable techno-economic considerations to integrate them into system and market operation. As a key point, the importance of recognizing the complexity of system services to guarantee stability in low-carbon grids is emphasized, along with the need to carefully integrate new grid codes and market mechanisms in order to exploit the full benefits of emerging technologies in the transition toward ultra-low carbon futures.

The value of energy storage systems (ESS) to provide fast frequency response has been more and more recognized. Although the development of energy storage technologies has made ESSs technically feasible to be integrated in larger scale with required performance, the policies, grid codes and economic issues are still presenting barriers for wider application and investment. Recent years, a few regions and countries have designed new services to meet the upcoming grid challenges. A number of grid-scale ESS projects are also implemented aiming to trial performance, demonstrate values, and gain experience.

  author = {{MIGRATE}},
  date = {2019},
  abstract = {A system with 100\% converter based generation presents new challenges to transmission system operators across all operational time-scales, in terms of system stability. Such systems are highly meshed, and power injections can be highly variable, and are not completely known in advance. Moreover, the network configuration may change in order to manage system congestion and/or planned/unplanned outages. Hence, new issues must be addressed and the operational procedures/rules for operating transmission networks need to be redefined for such a scenario, in order to ensure robustness against likely disturbances. This deliverable addresses rules that should be adopted by system operators when operating a 100\% converter based grid. Taking the all-island power system of Ireland and N. Ireland as a test case, a reduced system model was developed with all existing generation replaced by (large) converters of equivalent capacity, such that traditional power system security issues remained largely resolved, even with a 100\% converter based system. Subsequently, various studies were performed, for a range of system configurations, to identify the operational boundaries of the system, i.e. how many, and in which locations, should converters be grid-forming in a 100\% converter based system? Given that the steady-state voltage profile of the network was unchanged, it follows that replacing synchronous machine based generation with grid-forming inverters does not change the voltage/reactive power control requirements for the grid, with gridforming converters potentially receiving voltage setpoints from a control centre, as required. The 100\% converter based system was demonstrated to be robust against bolted 3-phase faults, with no or very little oscillations observed during and postfault, and with little variation in performance depending on fault location. In order to identify a lower bound on the grid-forming requirements (relative to grid-following converters) for such a system, various disturbances were applied at all network nodes for a range of converter configurations, and the ability of the system to satisfactorily survive such disturbances was observed. It was seen that a minimum of 37.5\% of the total online converter capacity (MVA) should be grid-forming, recognising the test system characteristics, and assuming that the individual converter bus nodes were either grid-forming or grid-following in nature, but not a combination of both. By studying the responses of individual grid-forming and grid-following converters for various fault conditions, the stability boundary, associated with the minimum gridforming requirement, was shown to be ultimately dependent on the PLL (phase-locked loop) gains of the grid-following converters. High (default) gains were seen to provide a strong sensitivity to changes in external system conditions, implying better synchronisation capability, which is generally desirable, but this was seen to be problematic during fault conditions, resulting in excessive system oscillations as the PLLs struggled to correctly follow the system frequency during and post fault clearance. Lower gains, implying that the PLL tracking was slower, were demonstrated to result in reduced oscillations in the considered scenarios, but this also led to less accurate control of the active and reactive power setpoints. In order to further understand the limitations of PLLs, their ability to operate correctly under fault conditions, depending on proximity to the fault location, as well as the duration of the fault, was investigated. It was established that while the minimum grid-forming requirement was based upon considering 100 ms, bolted 3-phase faults, the system was not robust against 250 ms faults, irrespective of whether high or low PLL gains were adopted. The concept of a fault critical clearing time was, therefore, observed, although the rationale for such a metric was clearly unrelated to a similar metric for synchronous machine dominated systems. In addition to applying faults, less severe events/disturbances, such as line disconnection and reclosure, were simulated. It was seen that the system quickly returned to its pre-fault state after a line was disconnected and reconnected, irrespective of whether the line openings were located near or far away from converter locations. Satisfactory (but slower) behaviour was also seen for the same disturbance, after a (large) grid-forming converter was replaced by a grid-following converter. Hence, it was established that topological changes were not seen as a significant issue for a 100\% converter based system, under the considered test conditions. Finally, recognising that converters, grid-forming or grid-following, may well be much smaller in size (MVA) compared to existing fossil-fired generation, it is plausible that they will be distributed somewhat unevenly around the network. Hence, individual buses may consist of a mix of grid-forming and grid-following converters, and different buses may experience different grid-forming shares. By splitting the Irish network into several regions, and adopting the same grid-forming share for all converters in a given region, but potentially different shares in other regions, it was seen that the previous grid-forming requirement could be reduced by 8-10\%, measured as a system-wide average. It was noted that the minimum grid-forming requirement in each region could be noticeably different from the system-wide average, and that the first signs of marginal stability were generally seen for faults close to individual converter nodes in regions with a particularly low grid-forming fraction.},

Environmental and sustainability concerns lead to replacement of a significant share of conventional fossil fuel-based power plants with renewable energy resources. This transition involves the major challenge of substituting synchronous machines and their well-known dynamics and controllers with power electronics-interfaced generation whose regulation and interaction with the rest of the system is yet to be fully understood. In this article, we review the challenges of such low-inertia power systems, and survey the solutions that have been put forward thus far. We strive to concisely summarize the laidout scientific foundations as well as the practical experiences of industrial and academic demonstration projects. We touch upon the topics of power system stability, modeling, and control, and we particularly focus on the role of frequency, inertia, as well as control of power converters and from the demand-side.},

  author = {Milligan, Michael and Frew, Bethany and Clark, Kara and Bloom, Aaron},
  date = {2017},
  abstract = {A common approach to regulating electricity is through auction-based competitive wholesale markets. The goal of this approach is to provide a reliable supply of power at the lowest reasonable cost to the consumer. This necessitates market structures and operating rules that ensure revenue sufficiency for all generators needed for resource adequacy purposes. Wholesale electricity markets employ marginal-cost pricing to provide cost-effective dispatch such that resources are compensated for their operational costs. However, marginal-cost pricing alone cannot guarantee cost recovery outside of perfect competition, and electricity markets have at least six attributes that preclude them from functioning as perfectly competitive markets. These attributes include market power, externalities, public good attributes, lack of storage, wholesale price caps, and ineffective demand curve. Until (and unless) these failures are ameliorated, some form of corrective action(s) will be necessary to improve market efficiency so that prices can correctly reflect the needed level of system reliability. Many of these options necessarily involve some form of administrative or out-of-market actions, such as scarcity pricing, capacity payments, bilateral or other out-of-market contracts, or some hybrid combination. A key focus with these options is to create a connection between the electricity market and long-term reliability/loss-of-load expectation targets, which are inherently disconnected in the native markets because of the aforementioned market failures. The addition of variable generation resources can exacerbate revenue sufficiency and resource adequacy concerns caused by these underlying market failures. Because variable generation resources have near-zero marginal costs, they effectively suppress energy prices and reduce the capacity factors of conventional generators through the merit-order effect in the simplest case of a convex market; non-convexities can also suppress prices.},

Then, partly based on theoretical work by Chao and Wilson [3], we illustrate the role of the scoring and the settlement rule as key elements of the market design. With sufficiently competitive markets, a settlement rule based on uniform pricing ensures efficient energy call in the balancing power market. A scoring rule based on capacity prices only ensures an efficient production schedule. Thus, both rules together with rational bidding ensure simultaneous efficiency on the balancing power market and the wholesale electricity market. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Electricity systems are constantly exposed to geopolitical, techno-economic and natural uncertainties that may endanger security of supply. Therefore, it is crucial that policy makers concerned about it consider a variety of possible futures — and not only the one that is perceived as the most likely. In particular, they should account for the possibility of sudden shocks in their decisions with the goal of making the system more “robust”. However, long-term power system models which are an important pillar of policy decision making are typically designed to determine the cost-minimal power system for a specific expected future; such a system is not necessarily the most robust one. By combining the classic investment optimization approach with the tools of Robust Decision Making we analyze the viability of different strategies that may potentially increase the robustness of a power system. For the case of the European power system we pursue a dedicated analysis with the European power system model LIMES-EU. Based on a total of more than 40,000 model runs, we find that strategies promoting the ability of countries to always produce at least 95\% of their electricity demand domestically significantly help to reduce the loss of load in case of shocks. Such a strategy is not cost-optimal for the expected future without shocks; but the additional costs (about 0.1\% of total system costs) are low compared to the benefits of significantly increasing the power system's robustness.},

Thermal power stations have traditionally provided system inertia, which acts as a natural aid to maintaining system frequency, so removing them from the system will impact how frequency is managed. System frequency is a measure of the balance between electrical power generated and consumed. In GB, the electricity system frequency is nominally 50Hz and the National Electricity Transmission System Operator (NETSO) balances generation and demand in real-time.},

The book provides an introduction to MIP modeling and to planning systems, a unique collection of reformulation results, and an easy to use problem-solving library. This approach is demonstrated through a series of real life case studies, exercises and detailed illustrations. Review by Jakub Marecek (Computer Journal) The emphasis put on mixed integer rounding and mixing sets, heuristics in-built in general purpose integer programming solvers, as well as on decompositions and heuristics using integer programming should be praised... There is no doubt that this volume offers the present best introduction to integer programming formulations of lotsizing problems, encountered in production planning. (2007)},

  abstract = {Modern power systems are undergoing a transitional phase, increasingly incorporating renewable energy sources (RES) to harness their economic and environmental benefits. The main challenge with this transitional phase is the management of the increased variability and uncertainty in the power balance. Legacy operation and planning practices are gradually seen as becoming inadequate or ill-adapted in addressing this challenge. One particular gap in the state of the art, which is of great importance, is estimating the operational flexibility potential of individual power system assets and their aggregation at the system level. System operators need to evaluate and plan ahead flexibility adequacy for their power systems in order to ensure feasible and economical operation under high RES penetration. Likewise, asset owners need to integrate the notion of asset flexibility as part of their investment and operations decisions. To this end, we propose the concept of the flexibility envelope to describe the flexibility potential dynamics of a power system and its individual resources in the operational planning time-frame. We demonstrate that the resulting envelope dynamics can be a starting point for flexibility adequacy planning in systems with highly variable generation.},

Additionally, we investigate the price developments in the German Secondary balancing power market. We find evidence that the suppliers coordinate on a price level which is (far) above the competitive level and that they orientate their power bids towards previous auction prices.},

For the integrated European procurement of balancing reserves, the European Commission proposes a multi-attributive auction mechanism which is very similar to the current German auction. The key difference, however, is a switch from pay-as-bid to uniform pricing. We develop a game-theoretical model of the current German and the future European balancing market design. Both market designs have desirable economic properties in their one-shot version, i.e., an efficient auction outcome and competitive prices. We show that a switch to uniform pricing does not induce bidders to report their true costs in their bids, but leads to underbidding. We contrast the equilibrium outcomes with German market data and find a substantial discrepancy, i.e., non-competitive prices. We provide a game-theoretical grounded explanation that is based on the regular repetition of the auction combined with the invariant supplier side.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Projections of future climate change play a fundamental role in improving understanding of the climate system as well as characterizing societal risks and response options. The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2\,°C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017–2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018–2020 period.},

Increasing the amounts of reserve to accommodate the increased stochasticity needs to be carefully justified since this resource comes at a cost. Therefore, reserve procurement needs to be determined considering both, the benefits in terms of reliability improvements and the increased operating costs to the system. Traditionally the procurement of this service has relied on deterministic rules-of-Thumb, while academic research has demonstrated the advantages of modeling the variability and uncertainty endogenously in the decision-making process through advanced scheduling methods. Those approaches do not explicitly model the risk (or its components) in the decision-making process. This work proposes practical methods to determine the reserve requirements to maintain risk (or risk component) below a desired threshold during system operation. Numerical results on the RTS-GMLC system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Despite significant recent improvements, such simulations still require significant computation times. Here we propose a method, based on clustering units, for approximate unit commitment with dramatic improvements in solution time. This method speeds computation by aggregating similar but non-identical units. This replaces large numbers of binary commitment variables with fewer integers while still capturing individual unit decisions and constraints. We demonstrate the trade-off between accuracy and run-time for different levels of aggregation. A numeric example using an ERCOT-based 205-unit system illustrates that careful aggregation introduces errors of 0.05\%-0.9\% across several metrics while providing several orders of magnitude faster solution times (400 ×) compared to traditional binary formulations. Further aggregation increases errors slightly ( 2×) with further speedup (2000 ×). We also compare other simplifications that can provide an additional order of magnitude speed-up for some problems.},

  abstract = {Electrical power systems have been traditionally designed to be reliable during normal conditions and abnormal but foreseeable contingencies. However, withstanding unexpected and less frequent severe situations still remains a significant challenge. As a critical infrastructure and in the face of climate change, power systems are more and more expected to be resilient to high-impact low-probability events determined by extreme weather phenomena. However, resilience is an emerging concept, and, as such, it has not yet been adequately explored in spite of its growing interest. On these bases, this paper provides a conceptual framework for gaining insights into the resilience of power systems, with focus on the impact of severe weather events. As quantifying the effect of weather requires a stochastic approach for capturing its random nature and impact on the different system components, a novel sequential Monte-Carlo-based time-series simulation model is introduced to assess power system resilience. The concept of fragility curves is used for applying weather- and time-dependent failure probabilities to system's components. The resilience of the critical power infrastructure is modeled and assessed within a context of system-of-systems that also include human response as a key dimension. This is illustrated using the IEEE 6-bus test system.},

This paper outlines the necessary steps in creating power systems with the flexibility needed to maintain stability and reliability while relying primarily on variable energy resources. These steps are provided in the form of a comprehensive overview of policies, technical changes, and institutional systems, organized in three development phases: an initial phase (penetration up to about 10\%) characterized by relatively mild changes to conventional power system operations and structures; a dynamic middle phase (up to about 50\% penetration) characterized by phasing out conventional generation and a concerted effort to wring flexibility from existing infrastructure; and the high penetration phase that inevitably addresses how power systems operate over longer periods of weeks or months when variable generation will be in either short supply, or in over-abundance. Although this transition is likely a decades-long and incremental process and depends on the specifics of each system, the needed policies, research, demonstration projects and institutional changes need to start now precisely because of the complexity of the transformation. The list of policy actions presented in this paper can serve as a guideline to policy makers on effectuating the transition and on tracking the preparedness of systems.},

These initiatives aim at improving geographical coordination among European transmission system operators, and better positioning the European system for integrating renewable resources through short-term operational efficiency and long-term investment in flexible resources. However, the European design is characterized by a missing market for real-time reserve capacity, that has been inherited from a failure to recognize the central role of real-time operations as the spot market of the electric power industry. This missing market undermines the valuation of reserve capacity, and the back-propagation of price signals to forward reserve markets that can support investment in reserves. The goal of the present paper is to develop a methodology that exposes the implications of this missing market. The methodology relies on analytical insights that can be derived under an assumption of price-taking behavior. These insights are validated by a simulation model which represents the European balancing market as a Markov Decision Process. The simulation model is used for validating the analytical insights and testing the ability of various balancing market design options to back-propagate the real-time value of reserve to forward reserve markets.},

A real-time market for reserve capacity is essential in the implementation of scarcity pricing, in order to enable the back-propagation of the value of reserve capacity to forward markets for energy and reserve. Such a market for real-time reserve capacity does not exist currently in Europe. Consequently, the existing design of the European balancing market creates challenges for the valuation of reserves. We argue that the implementation of a real-time market for reserve capacity can be aligned with European legislation, and we describe how scarcity pricing based on operating reserve demand curves can be integrated in such a design.

  abstract = {Distributed generation is being deployed at increasing levels of penetration on electricity grids worldwide. It can have positive impacts on the network, but also negative impacts if integration is not properly managed. This is especially true of photovoltaics, in part because it's output fluctuates significantly and in part because it is being rapidly deployed in many countries. Potential positive impacts on grid operation can include reduced network flows and hence reduced losses and voltage drops. Potential negative impacts at high penetrations include voltage fluctuations, voltage rise and reverse power flow, power fluctuations, power factor changes, frequency regulation and harmonics, unintentional islanding, fault currents and grounding issues. This paper firstly reviews each of these impacts in detail, along with the current technical approaches available to address them. The second section of this paper discusses key non-technical factors, such as appropriate policies and institutional frameworks, which are essential to effectively coordinate the development and deployment of the different technical solutions most appropriate for particular jurisdictions. These frameworks will be different for different jurisdictions, and so no single approach will be appropriate worldwide. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The displacement of synchronous generators with inverter-based sources in the electric grid can results in larger frequency deviations due to lower rotating inertial energy. Existing grid-tied inverters operate as grid-following sources that track the voltage angle of the grid to control their output. Even with inverter fast frequency support, frequency regulation still depends on the remaining synchronous generators. In contrast, grid-forming sources actively control their frequency output, making it possible for them to naturally support the system frequency while sharing a portion of the load change. In this work, the impact of grid-forming and grid-following inverter controllers on the system frequency dynamics is studied and compared. A simple two-source system is modeled, and the small-signal dynamic characteristics are studied at various penetration levels and varying levels of mechanical inertia. The resulting eigenvalue trajectories are presented and these analytical results are validated by the corresponding time-domain plots. The results exhibit significant dynamic response advantages of the grid-forming inverter over its grid-following counterpart, particularly under the most demanding conditions when the penetration level of inverter-based sources reaches high levels and the available system stored inertial energy drops.},

  abstract = {Voltage source converters use filters to connect to the grid in order to limit the harmonic content injected to the grid. Compared to a simple inductor (L-filter), LCL-filters result in a lower total inductance value. Losses are reduced and the dynamics are preserved, but stability problems can arise in the current-control loop if the LCL-filter resonance is not properly damped. Passive damping adds dissipative elements to the LCL-filter capacitors. The control software (nested controllers for current and DC voltage) does not need to be modified, but there are additional losses and encumbrances. In spite of its disadvantages, passive damping is widely used in the industry because of its simplicity. Active damping modifies the control algorithm to obtain current-control stability. The control procedure becomes more complex and sometimes additional sensors are necessary. Literature presents many options for the LCL-filter design, passive damping design, and active damping design, and this chapter will present well-known practical methods. In this chapter, the LCL-filter design uses a step-by-step procedure with simple formulas that avoid trial-and-error iterations. Different configurations for passive damping are shown with design and stability considerations along with simple formulas for estimating the passive damping losses. The procedures presented for active damping preserve the nested controller configuration, and they are feedback type and filter based. Feedback-type procedures result in a robust design against line inductance variations. The capacitor-current feedback method requires an additional sensor and the lead-lag network avoid additional sensors by using the capacitor voltage also for synchronization. The filter-based procedure presented in the chapter uses a notch filter at the voltage reference output to the modulator. The procedure is straightforward, but it may require an estimation of resonance frequency when large grid inductance variations are present. The techniques explained in this chapter constitute the basis of the past and the ongoing research on LCL-filter-based grid converters.},

  abstract = {Ongoing climate change affects complex and long-lived infrastructures like electricity systems. Particularly for decarbonized electricity systems based on variable renewable energies, there is a variety of impact mechanisms working differently in size and direction. Main impacts for Europe include changes in wind and solar resources, hydro power, cooling water availability for thermoelectric generation and electricity demand. Hence, it is not only important to understand the total effects, i.e., how much welfare may be gained when accounting for climate change impacts in all dimensions, but also to disentangle various effects in terms of their marginal contribution to the potential welfare loss. This paper applies a two-stage modeling framework to assess very strong climate change impacts on a cost-optimally decarbonized, highly renewables-based European electricity system. Thereby, the performance of two electricity system design strategies – one based on no anticipation of climate change and one anticipating impacts of climate change – is studied under a variety of climate change impacts. Impacts on wind and solar resources are found to cause the largest system effects in 2100. Combined climate change impacts increase system costs of a system designed without climate change anticipation due to increased fuel and carbon permit costs. Applying a system design strategy with climate change anticipation increases the cost-optimal share of variable renewable energy based on additional wind offshore capacity in 2100, at a reduction in nuclear, wind onshore and solar photovoltaics capacity. Compared to a no anticipation strategy, total system costs are reduced.},

This discussion is central in the development and implementation of the European Electricity Balancing Guideline. Based on a multi-level simulation tool with a realistic modelling of short-term power system operations, this paper proposes the first quantitative assessment of postponing the balancing gate closure time from 1 h to 15 min ahead of the imbalance settlement period. For different environments (energy mix, power plant capabilities, outages, etc), the results highlight that postponing the balancing gate closure time from 1 h to 15 min increases the operational cost of the system. Based on robust and scalable results, we show that this difference is mainly due to a better coordination of the available resources by the central decision maker.},

Developed over the second half of the twentieth century, they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy, energy security and economic development concerns, and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making. \& 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This might be problematic if much of the conventional generation fleet is displaced by inverters. To solve this problem, grid-forming control for inverters has been proposed as being capable of autonomously regulating grid voltages and frequency. Presently, the performance of bulk power systems with massive penetration of grid-forming inverters has not been thoroughly studied as to elucidate benefits. Hence, this paper presents inverter models with two grid-forming strategies: virtual oscillator control and droop control. The two models are specifically developed to be used in positive-sequence simulation packages and have been implemented in PSLF. The implementations are used to study the performance of bulk power grids incorporating inverters with gridforming capability. Specifically, simulations are conducted on a modified IEEE 39-bus test system and the microWECC test system with varying levels of synchronous and inverter-based generation. The dynamic performance of the tested systems with gridforming inverters during contingency events is better than cases with only synchronous generation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Solar photovoltaic (PV) energy is one of the fastest growing renewable energy sources globally. However, the dependency of PV generation on climatological factors such as the intensity of radiation, temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, etc can impact future power generation capacity. Considering the future large-scale deployment of PV systems, accurate climate information is essential for PV site selection, stable grid regulation, planning and energy output projections. In this study, the long-term changes in the future PV potential are estimated over Australia using regional climate projections for the near-future (2020–2039) and far-future (2060–2079) periods under a high emission scenario that projects 3.4 °C warming by 2100. The effects of projected changes in shortwave downwelling radiation, temperature and wind speed on the future performance of PV systems over Australia is also examined. Results indicate decline in the future PV potential over most of the continent due to reduced insolation and increased temperature. Northern coastal Australia experiences negligible increase in PV potential during the far future period due to increase in radiation and wind speed in that region. On further investigation, we find that the cell temperatures are projected to increase in the future under a high emission scenario (2.5 °C by 2079), resulting in increased degradation and risks of failure. The elevated cell temperatures significantly contribute to cell efficiency losses, that are expected to increase in the future (6–13 d yr               −1               for multi-crystalline silicon cells) mostly around Western and central Australia indicating further reductions in PV power generation. Therefore, long-term PV power projections can help understand the variations in future power generation and identify regions where PV systems will be highly susceptible to losses in Australia.},

Conventional thermal generation based on synchronous machines is gradually being replaced by power electronics interfaced renewable generation. This new mode of generation, however, lacks the natural inertia and governor damping which are quintessential features of synchronous machines. The loss of these features results in increasing frequency excursions and, ultimately, system instability. Among the numerous studies on mitigating these undesirable effects, the main approach involves virtual inertia emulation to mimic the behavior of synchronous machines. In this work, explicit models of grid-following and grid-forming virtual inertia (VI) devices are developed for inertia emulation and fast frequency response in low-inertia systems. An optimization problem is formulated to optimize the parameters and location of these devices in a power system to increase its resilience. Finally, a case study based on a high-fidelity model of the South-East Australian system is used to illustrate the effectiveness of such devices.},

In this paper we show that the design variables that affect DER access to and participation in the organized balancing market include different features of auction configuration as well as a number of formal, administrative and technical aspects of market design. In a comparative case study of the balancing markets in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, we determine the extent to which a given market design effectively facilitates DER participation. To structure this analysis, we designed an assessment framework that provides a comprehensive tool for the assessment of balancing markets in Europe vis-à-vis DER participation. Our results show that flexible pooling conditions, a higher bidding frequency and product resolution, and the authorization of non-precontracted bids, among others, can significantly ease DER integration in the market. Different design variables, however, can enhance or neutralize each other's effects, so their interrelations need to be taken into account in order to achieve an improved and harmonized balancing market design.},

In this paper, we provide an overview and assessment of these arrangements in Australia’s National Electricity Market - a useful case study given its long-standing frequency control ancillary services markets, yet recent challenges in maintaining secure frequency control. We assess the performance of these evolving arrangements in delivering improved frequency control outcomes, with particular regard to growing renewable penetrations and evident tensions between mandatory requirements and market-based incentives. Based on this assessment, we draw out four key insights on designing frequency control arrangements as power system capabilities and needs change: (1) Understanding control action interactions, (2) Implementing efficient price formation and costallocation mechanisms, (3) Monitoring and assessing service provision to better align participant remuneration with service quality, and (4) Considering both regulatory and market mechanisms and their consequences and interactions. In particular, we discuss the trade-offs between effective and efficient outcomes, and provide arguments for more robust and forward-looking frequency control arrangements during energy transition.},

  abstract = {Across several power systems with market frameworks, policy-makers are proposing that balancing flexibility requirements emerging during energy transition be addressed through new reserve product markets. However, these may introduce additional costs, constraints and complexity, and even encroach upon the functions of existing operational practices. Thus, policy-makers need to assess and compare flexibility design options, and quantifying system flexibility capabilities based on current and expected resource mixes can assist in achieving this. In this article, we offer a practical method to quantify the time-varying spectrum of upwards and downwards flexibility capabilities in systems, and subsequently apply it to historical and projected resource mixes in two regions of the Australian National Electricity Market. Our results suggest that with higher penetrations of renewable energy: (1) downwards flexibility margins can be exhausted around noon if wind and solar are unable or unwilling to provide it, (2) upwards flexibility becomes more scarce during morning and evening peak demand events and (3) a greater portion of upwards flexibility is provided by energy-limited resources. Given these trends, we recommend that policy-makers examine how existing operational practices can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility provision, and that duration specifications and sustained footroom procurement be considered for reserve products.},

  abstract = {The vulnerability of a system is best addressed by introducing some form of resilience, hard or soft, to the risks associated with the physical, social and economic aspects of the system’s ability to cope with disturbing events. Once the resilience options have been identified to meet the vulnerability of a system, it is necessary to compare the degree of resilience that the different alternatives may offer. The different concepts are examined to propose both a qualitative and a possible quantification of the degree of resilience that may be achieved by the different measures proposed for implementation. Cost Benefit Analysis is one technique used by governments and public authorities for appraising the societal benefits of public investment projects and policies. Generally, it is used to organize and present the costs and benefits, and inherent trade-offs, and to ultimately estimate the economic efficiency of projects. Is it better to be content with protection against 20-year floods or should an extra cost be considered to provide safety against centennial floods? Thus, after showing that the benefits outweigh the costs of the project and adding value to society, Cost Benefit Analysis can be used to single out the best option. As benefits and costs are difficult to estimate with certainty, some measure of uncertainty or sensitivity has to be discussed when comparing the resilience project options.},

  abstract = {In many areas of industry and society, including energy, healthcare, and logistics, agents collect vast amounts of data that are deemed proprietary. These data owners extract predictive information of varying quality and relevance from data depending on quantity, inherent information content, and their own technical expertise. Aggregating these data and heterogeneous predictive skills, which are distributed in terms of ownership, can result in a higher collective value for a prediction task. In this paper, a platform for improving predictions via the implicit pooling of private information in return for possible remuneration is envisioned. Specifically, a wagering-based forecast elicitation market platform has been designed, in which a buyer intending to improve their forecasts posts a prediction task, and sellers respond to it with their forecast reports and wagers. This market delivers an aggregated forecast to the buyer (pre-event) and allocates a payoff to the sellers (post-event) for their contribution. A payoff mechanism is proposed and it is proven that it satisfies several desirable economic properties, including those specific to electronic platforms. Furthermore, the properties of the forecast aggregation operator and scoring rules are discussed in order to emphasize their effect on the sellers’ payoff. Finally, numerical examples are provided in order to illustrate the structure and properties of the proposed market platform.},

  abstract = {Electricity grid planners design the system to supply electricity to end-users reliably and affordably. Climate change threatens both objectives through potentially compounding supplyand demand-side climate-induced impacts. Uncertainty surrounds each of these future potential impacts. Given long planning horizons, system planners must weigh investment costs against operational costs under this uncertainty. Here, we developed a comprehensive and coherent integrated modeling framework combining physically based models with cost-minimizing optimization models in the power system. We applied this modeling framework to analyze potential tradeoffs in planning and operating costs in the power grid due to climate change in the Southeast U.S. in 2050. We find that planning decisions that do not account for climate-induced impacts would result in a substantial increase in social costs associated with loss of load. These social costs are a result of under-investment in new capacity and capacity deratings of thermal generators when we included climate change impacts in the operation stage. These results highlight the importance of including climate change effects in the planning process.},

Using a staggered introduction of grid-scale batteries in two Australian states, our difference-in-differences analysis shows that grid-scale batteries can significantly lower overall FCAS costs. We further show that the reduced FCAS costs are accentuated by the battery storage capacity, and that their impacts are most pronounced in reducing the costs of short-term FCAS markets (such as the regulation and 6-second services). These FCAS markets typically displace more expensive fossil-fuel participation. Given the large scale of both battery and renewable adoption in Australia, our results have policy implications for global energy markets.},

The paper examines the interaction between strategic hydro reservoir operation and transmission capacity constraints, and summarizes the implications of market power for system reliability.

Here we examine these tensions through an interdisciplinary study that reveals the diversity of possible algorithms and their accompanying material effects, focused on neighbourhood-scale batteries (NSBs) in Australia. We conducted qualitative research with energy sector professionals and citizens to understand the range of perceived benefits and risks of NSBs and the algorithms that drive their behaviour. Issues raised by stakeholders were integrated into NSB optimization algorithms whose effects on NSB owners and customers were quantified through techno-economic modelling. Our results show the allocation of benefits and risks vary considerably between different algorithm designs. This indicates a need to improve energy algorithm governance, enabling accountability and responsiveness across the design and use of algorithms so that the digitization of energy technology does not lead to adverse public outcomes.},

In contrast to the prevalent linear-programming-based electricity markets, we highlight how the inclusion of second-order cone constraints enables uncertainty-, asset- and network-awareness of the market, which is key to the successful transition towards an electricity system based on weather-dependent renewable energy sources. We analyze our general market-clearing proposal using conic duality theory to derive efficient spatially-differentiated prices for the multiple commodities, comprising of energy and flexibility services. Under the assumption of perfect competition, we prove the equivalence of the centrally-solved market-clearing optimization problem to a competitive spatial price equilibrium involving a set of rational and self-interested participants and a price setter. Finally, under common assumptions, we prove that moving towards conic markets does not incur the loss of desirable economic properties of markets, namely market efficiency, cost recovery and revenue adequacy. Our numerical studies focus on the specific use case of uncertainty-aware market design and demonstrate that the proposed conic market brings advantages over existing alternatives within the linear programming market framework.},

This paper introduces the use of stochastic programming to solve the DC optimal power flow problem with scenarios drawn directly from high-fidelity data sets. Hence, the proposed method avoids the problem of lost physics by finding high-fidelity analogs that can describe future states of the system. Furthermore, this method can be simply extended to output multi-period scenarios to the stochastic program. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique by simulating dispatch operations on a synthetic test system over the course of a week.},

  abstract = {Efficient wholesale electricity markets should drive preference revealing bidding where generators offer the majority of their power at their short run marginal cost (SRMC). However, most renewables have very low SRMCs, which in a competitive market is likely to lead to an increasing proportion of low priced periods. Combined with concerns around the variable availability of some renewable generation types, this has led to suggestions that energy-only markets may need to be augmented with capacity remuneration mechanisms as their renewable penetration grows. This analysis explores the operation of energy-only markets with high renewables, with a case study of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Results suggest that existing energy-only market mechanisms have the potential to operate effectively in a 100\% renewables scenario, but success will rely upon two critical factors. Firstly, an increase in the Market Price Cap is likely to be required. Preliminary analysis suggests this may need to increase from the present \$13,500/ MWh in the NEM to the range \$60,000 to \$80,000 /MWh. Alternatively, comprehensive demand side participation could allow each customer to select their preferred level of reliability and associated cost, removing the need for an administratively determined Market Price Cap. Secondly, a liquid and well-functioning derivative contracts market will be required to allow generators and retailers to hedge increased market risks successfully.},

  abstract = {Renewable technologies are often characterized as being somewhat different to 'conventional' generating technologies in three ways, each with different implications for electricity markets. Firstly, some have highly variable and somewhat uncertain availability, meaning that electricity markets must be designed to elicit adequate flexibility. Secondly, many have very low short-run marginal costs (operating costs), meaning that the mechanisms for managing resource adequacy must be carefully considered. Thirdly, some are nonsynchronous, meaning that grid codes and regulatory requirements must be appropriately designed. Access to flexibility can be enhanced by a range of market design choices, such as short dispatch intervals, short delays from gate closure to dispatch, large balancing areas, high demand side participation, and exposing renewable technologies to market price signals commensurate with other technologies. The design of markets for frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) also provides opportunities to increase access to flexibility, by creating active real-time markets for a wide range of FCAS, allowing renewable technologies to provide FCAS, and determining FCAS reserve requirements dynamically in real time. Mechanisms for managing resource adequacy are a source of ongoing debate, with many of the key issues having been exacerbated by the entry of renewables. Rapid market change makes investment decisions difficult, regardless of the market model applied. Ultimately, given the existence of arguably successful examples of both energy-only and capacity market designs, the choice of market model may be less important than the quality of governance with which it is implemented and maintained.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a thorough review of 75 modelling tools currently used for analysing energy and electricity systems. Increased activity within model development in recent years has led to several new models and modelling capabilities, partly motivated by the need to better represent the integration of variable renewables. The purpose of this paper is to give an updated overview of currently available modelling tools, their capabilities and to serve as an aid for modellers in their process of identifying and choosing an appropriate model. A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal resolution as well as the technological and economic features of the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date. With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling studies.},

  abstract = {Balancing markets are critical for the operation of power systems. TSOs use these markets for the acquisition of the resources needed for the balance between generation and demand on real-time (minute-to-minute operation). Balancing markets, since their beginning, were conceived to cope with real-time operation issues such as forecast errors on generation/demand and unplanned power outages due to a fault on generation units or transmission facility. Today, balancing markets are facing new challenges. One of them is the incorporation of a considerable amount of intermittent renewable generation on the generation mix, which could impose an increase on the volumes traded on balancing markets in order to ensure the correct performance of the system. Another issue is the tendency of displacing national energy markets by regional markets within which multi-area Day-Ahead trading is managed. This article presents the current designs of several European balancing markets, i.e. The Belgian, Swiss, German, Danish, Spanish, French, Italian and Dutch balancing markets. Since control reserves vary from one system to another, this article first presents a classification of the control reserves used within the surveyed systems. From the classification we proceed to the comparison of the assessment, remuneration (methods and structure), and cost recovery for secondary and tertiary reserves applied by each TSO.},

The book chapter emphasizes on the current controlling strategies of power converters operating in different modes with AC microgrid system simplified structure. The challenging part to meet the defined output parameters for Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) with increased penetration of the same is also jagged with controlling strategies of power converters. DER and ESS are integral part of microgrid and for AC microgrid they require converter interface. Various converter topologies and their control is included. Microgrid requires extensive control strategy to meet with grid requirements and load requirements under verity of conditions. Control strategies of multilevel is used. Control methods related to primary control, secondary and tertiary control is discussed. The crucial parameter for selection of power converters control, selection of L, LC and LCL filters, according to application is included. Moreover, depending on the operating modes i.e. Grid Connection Mode and Stand-Alone Mode the respective control strategies are compared for the better understanding along with requirement of synchronization to estimate several grid parameters to achieve accurate control of the active and reactive power delivered to the grid.},

There is a wide range of models under this new hybrid regime which essentially combine the energy market with planning and long-term risk transfer arrangements. This paper takes an institutionalist approach in terms of modularity of the market design, and reviews the issues with the standard historical market model which led to the introduction of additional long term “modules”. We then study the interactions between the existing and new “modules” and identify ways in which the initial market modules can be improved to address inconsistencies with the new modules. We conclude by discussing the conditions under which the various changes in market architectures could converge toward a hybrid regime structured around a “two step competition”, with a “competition for the market” via the auctioning of long-term contracts to support investment, followed by “competition in the market” for short term system optimisation via the energy market.},

The initial focus in the 1990s was on creating an integrated market fostering efficient cross border trade and competition, which delivered significant benefits and is still ongoing via the Network Codes and the Clean Energy Package implementation process. However, changing policy priorities in the 2000s, namely climate change mitigation and security of supply,have creatednew challenges for market integration through a revival of national uncoordinatedpublicinterventions. European electricity markets have therefore in recent years evolved towardsa patchwork of hybrid markets featuring:i) support mechanisms for clean technologies; ii) capacity mechanisms addressing security of supply concerns; and iii) new planning processes to coordinate generation and grid development.The chapter investigates these hybrid markets and the conditions for the emergence of a more structuredand coordinated new target model.},

The lack of demand-side response, short-term reliability management procedures and non-market ancillary services provision often undermine market reflective scarcity pricing and distort long-term investment incentives. The introduction of a capacity mechanism should come as an optional supplement to wholesale and ancillary markets improvements. Priority reforms should focus on encouraging demand-side responsiveness and reducing scarcity price distortions introduced by balancing and congestion management through better dialog between network engineers and market operators. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In many applications of power converters, an AC voltage with a controllable/variable frequency and voltage amplitude is desired (e.g., in motor-drive applications). By contrast, in the case of grid-connected applications (e.g., photovoltaic systems), the output AC voltage should be «constant» in terms of frequency and amplitude. In all, a power electronic interface is required to link the DC source with the load and to make the output AC voltage compatible in terms of phase, frequency, and amplitude. This power processing is called DC/AC conversion, and the power converters are referred to as DC/AC converters, also known as DC/AC inverters. Depending on the system power ratings, there are typically single- and three-phase DC/AC converters. In order to achieve the above goal (e.g., a constant-voltage and constant-frequency AC voltage), a proper control should be employed. In this chapter, the modeling and control of DC/AC converters are briefly presented in different reference frames (i.e., αβ- and dq-reference frames). The design of commonly employed DC-link and current controllers is in focus with different case studies.},

We analyse four pioneering projects implementing flexibility markets: Piclo Flex, Enera, GOPACS, and NODES. Based on a literature review, we develop a six-question framework. We find that all of the considered flexibility markets are operated by a third party. All projects also engage with multiple DSOs to become the standardized platform provider. Differences among the projects are found in the extent to which the flexibility markets are integrated into other existing markets, the use of reservation payments, the use of standardized products, and the way TSO-DSO cooperation is done. The answers to these questions vary for the projects because of different visions, use cases, or project maturity. Our case study analysis of four pioneering projects enriches the taxonomy and shows that practice is moving faster than the conceptual debate around flexibility markets.},

Not to forget 2 more amazing humans who chose to be generous but anonymous! Full Changlog Backwards-incompatible Changes Python 3.5 is not supported anymore. \#988 Deprecations Python 3.6 is now deprecated and support will be removed in the next release. \#1017 Changes attrs.field() now supports an alias option for explicit \_\_init\_\_ argument names. Get \_\_init\_\_ signatures matching any taste, peculiar or plain! The PEP 681 compatible alias option can be use to override private attribute name mangling, or add other arbitrary field argument name overrides. \#950 attrs.NOTHING is now an enum value, making it possible to use with e.g. typing.Literal. \#983 Added missing re-import of attr.AttrsInstance to the attrs namespace. \#987 Fix slight performance regression in classes with custom \_\_setattr\_\_ and speedup even more. \#991 Class-creation performance improvements by switching performance-sensitive templating operations to f-strings. You can expect an improvement of about 5\% -- even for very simple classes. \#995 attrs.has() is now a TypeGuard for AttrsInstance. That means that type checkers know a class is an instance of an attrs class if you check it using attrs.has() (or attr.has()) first. \#997 Made attrs.AttrsInstance stub available at runtime and fixed type errors related to the usage of attrs.AttrsInstance in Pyright. \#999 On Python 3.10 and later, call abc.update\_abstractmethods() on dict classes after creation. This improves the detection of abstractness. \#1001 attrs's pickling methods now use dicts instead of tuples. That is safer and more robust across different versions of a class. \#1009 Added attrs.validators.not\_(wrapped\_validator) to logically invert wrapped\_validator by accepting only values where wrapped\_validator rejects the value with a ValueError or TypeError (by default, exception types configurable). \#1010 The type stubs for attrs.cmp\_using() now have default values. \#1027 To conform with PEP 681, attr.s() and attrs.define() now accept unsafe\_hash in addition to hash. \#1065},

  abstract = {We introduce a new framework for resilience, which is traditionally understood as the ability of a system to absorb disturbances and maintain its state, by proposing a shift from a state-based to a system functioning-based approach to resilience, which takes into account that several different coexisting stable states could fulfill the same functioning. As a consequence, not every regime shift, i.e., transition from one stable state to another, is associated with a lack or loss of resilience. We emphasize the importance of flexibility—the ability of a system to shift between different stable states while still maintaining system functioning. Furthermore, we provide a classification of system responses based on the phenomenological properties of possible disturbances, including the role of their timescales. Therefore, we discern fluctuations, shocks, press disturbances, and trends as possible disturbances. We distinguish between two types of mechanisms of resilience: (i) tolerance and flexibility, which are properties of the system, and (ii) adaptation and transformation, which are processes that alter the system’s tolerance and flexibility. Furthermore, we discuss quantitative methods to investigate resilience in model systems based on approaches developed in dynamical systems theory.},

  abstract = {Optimization models are a widely used tool in academia. In order to build these models, various parameters need to be specified, and often, simplifications are necessary to ensure the tractability of the models; both of which introduce uncertainty about the model results. However, a widely accepted way to quantify how these uncertainties propagate does not exist. Using the example of power system expansion modeling, we show that uncertainty propagation in optimization models can systematically be described by quantifying the sensitivity to different model parameters and model designs. We quantify the sensitivity based on a misallocation measure with clearly defined mathematical properties for two prominent examples: the cost of capital and different model resolutions. When used to disclose sensitivity information in power system studies our approach can contribute to openness and transparency in power system research. It is found that power system models are particularly sensitive to the temporal resolution of the underlying time series.},

This paper evaluates the potential operating profit available through arbitrage operation for a price-maker storage facility in Alberta. Considering a five-year period from 2010 to 2014, hourly generation and demand price quota curves (GPQCs and DPQCs) are constructed to incorporate price impact as an input to the self-scheduling problem of a price-maker storage facility. The self-scheduling model is applied to the historical hourly GPQCs and DPQCs of the Alberta electricity market to investigate the potential economic performance of a price-maker energy storage facility.},

  abstract = {Energy storage will play a key role in the unfolding energy transition, but current market design and the modeling efforts that inform discussions surrounding its role broadly assume that these systems will not be deployed in ways deleterious to the objectives of the wider power grid. This is myopic: there are plausible and strategic modes of storage operation that clash with wider grid objectives while maximizing profits for storage system owners. Here we compare three modes: one that is commonly modeled and is broadly beneficial to the power system—peak shaving—with two plausible but deleterious ones—load leveraging and ramp augmen­ ting—and show how the latter two increase system costs and help generators earn substantial profits even when they bid at marginal cost. Our work adds to a growing literature about the unintended consequences of energy storage on the power system and elaborates the essential role of policy makers and regulators in mitigating these effects.},

  abstract = {The electricity market is being increasingly challenged by new trends, such as the high penetration of intermittent renewables and the transformation of the consumers’ energy space. To accommodate these new trends and improve the performance of the market, several modifications to current market designs have been proposed in the literature. Given the vast variety of these proposals, and focusing on the short-term timescale within the context of European electricity markets, this paper provides a comprehensive investigation of the modifications proposed in the literature as well as a detailed assessment of their suitability for improving market performance under the continuously evolving electricity landscape. To this end, first, the barriers present in current market designs hindering the fulfilment of an efficient performance are identified. Then, the different market solutions proposed in the literature, which could potentially mitigate these barriers, are extensively explored. Finally, a taxonomy of the proposed solutions is presented, highlighting the barriers addressed by each proposal and the associated implementation challenges. The outcomes of this analysis show that even though each barrier is addressed by at least one proposed solution, no single proposal is able to address all the barriers simultaneously. In this regard, a future-proof market design must combine different elements of proposed solutions to comprehensively mitigate market barriers and overcome the identified implementation challenges. Thus, by thoroughly reviewing this rich body of literature, this paper introduces key contributions enabling the advancement of the state-of-the-art towards increasingly efficient electricity markets.},

  abstract = {For many years, energy market design has held great promises as a solution to current energy issues; ranging from increasing international trade to emissions reduction, the securing of future electricity capacity, and increasing flexibility amid growing intermittent renewable energy resources. The emerging economic understandings of the energy infrastructure motivate conceptual and methodological innovations in the social sciences, which this paper pursues. Its first part describes recent advances in social studies of markets, which seek greater appreciation of the role of economics in the formation of markets via economic theories, instruments, and many other means. The second part focuses on emerging studies which draw on these approaches to examine energy systems including their markets, liberalisation, and sustainability. The essay brings together social studies of markets with energy and opens up important topics for understanding current energy transitions. These include how financial systems can be treated as key components of the socio-technical energy system in transition; and conversely, how the case of energy adds to the theories of social studies of markets and economics by highlighting manifold interdependencies between economics, engineering problems, existing infrastructures, and political contentions when market-based energy is at stake.},

  abstract = {This article adopts frameworks and methods from Science and Technology Studies for examining Energy Systems Integration (ESI). ESI, the integrated operation and planning of multiple energy supplies and demands, can contribute to improvements in energy reliability, security and flexibility, and therefore facilitate a transition to a low carbon economy. The article examines UK research towards integrated computer models of energy system ‘vectors’. The research is based on fieldwork and participation in a large ESI research project in the UK, drawing on interviews, workshops and observations. We highlight three main contributions to the studies on ESI and STS research of modelling. First, ESI researchers are aware of the social, economic and political context of their work, though many of these contexts are difficult to incorporate in any useful modelling process. Second, issues that touch on both science and policy around energy systems were the motivation for ESI researchers yet were also underemphasised in project work. Third, we develop unique mixed ethnographic methods to study ESI and that enable researchers to build relations of trust with research participants that contribute to the discussion of sensitive topics such as the politics and ethics of energy modelling approaches.},

  abstract = {This article considers academic energy modelling as a scientific practice. While models and modelling have been of considerable interest in energy social science research, few studies have brought together approaches from philosophy of science and anthropology to examine energy models both conceptually and in the applied sense. We develop a conceptual approach on epistemological ethics that distinguishes between epistemic values – such as accuracy, simplicity, and adequate representation – and non-epistemic values – such as policy relevance, methodological limitations, and learning – built into energy models. The research question is: how do modellers articulate and negotiate epistemic values and what does this imply for the status of models in scientific practice and policymaking? The empirical part of the article draws from ethnographic fieldwork and interviews amongst 40 energy modellers in university research groups in the UK from two complementary arenas: scholars preparing their PhD in modelling and scholars working in a large-scale energy modelling project. Our research uses ethnographic methods to complement themes recognised in earlier literatures on modelling, demonstrating what models and modellers know about the energy system and how they come to know it in particular ways.},

This research programme has exposed challenges in complex systems thinking and in the dialogue between academic disciplines and epistemic cultures that is needed to mediate the social, technological, and environmental impacts of energy systems. This chapter examines these efforts starting from existing studies that include detailed reports on experiences of interdisciplinary research. By extending these findings via interviews and ethnographic research, this chapter pays particular attention to the role of interdisciplinary computer modelling that was expected to represent complex energy transitions and energy infrastructures of the future. In doing so, this chapter demonstrates how interdisciplinarity has actually worked in three exemplary areas: the diversity of computer models that seek to represent everyday energy demand and how they simplify both demand and other disciplines in so doing; the need for collaborative, cross-cutting research in foresight of future energy scenarios; and how modelling scholars strongly envision their models should become ‘useful’ for imagined policy and planning stakeholders.},

Sometimes it involves multistage power conversion with two or more converters connected in series/parallel or in cascade fashion.

South Australia and Western Australia, in particular, are at the world's forefront of the consequential new challenges in maintaining a secure electricity grid. These emerge primarily with respect to frequency and voltage instability, converter interoperability, and variability and forecasting issues. As a result, operating strategies that worked well in energy markets dominated by conventional generators must be transformed to take into account the physical characteristics and probabilistic capabilities of emerging energy conversion processes. In turn, these approaches must be incorporated into the mechanisms and rules that will govern new low-carbon electricity markets.

Findings: Ongoing or forthcoming electricity sector restructuring activities in some countries can be better designed based on lessons learnt from existing markets and incorporating their own political, technical and economical contexts. A template for design of successful electricity market has also been presented. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to a comparative analysis of five markets and can be extended in the future for other existing and emerging electricity markets. Practical implications: The discussed weaknesses and strengths of existing electricity markets in this study can be practically utilized to improve the electricity industry market structures leading to several social benefits including lower electricity cost. Originality/value: The comprehensive review and analysis of five existing markets, physically located in different continents, may be used as an assistance or reference guide to benefit the emerging electricity markets in other countries. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Exploring this rise through nine thematic lenses—covering issues of climate governance, the fossil fuel industry, geopolitics, economics, mitigation modeling, energy systems, inequity, lifestyles, and social imaginaries—draws out multifaceted reasons for our collective failure to bend the global emissions curve. However, a common thread that emerges across the reviewed literature is the central role of power, manifest in many forms, from a dogmatic political-economic hegemony and influential vested interests to narrow techno-economic mindsets and ideologies of control. Synthesizing the various impediments to mitigation reveals how delivering on the commitments enshrined in the Paris Agreement now requires an urgent and unprecedented transformation away from today’s carbon- and energy-intensive development paradigm.},

This gradual transformation of the power system to a low-inertia system leads to critical challenges in maintaining system stability. Novel control techniques for converters, so-called grid-forming strategies, are expected to address these challenges and replicate functionalities that, so far, have been provided by SMs. This article presents a low-inertia case study that includes SMs and converters controlled under various grid-forming techniques. In this article, the positive impact of the grid-forming converters (GFCs) on the frequency stability of SMs is highlighted, a qualitative analysis that provides insights into the frequency stability of the system is presented, we explore the behavior of the grid-forming controls when imposing the converter dc and ac current limitations, the importance of the dc dynamics in grid-forming control design as well as the critical need for an effective ac current limitation scheme are reported, and finally, we analyze how and when the interaction between the fast GFC and the slow SM dynamics can contribute to the system instability.},

  abstract = {High penetration of wind generation causes concerns over frequency stability, as currently wind plants do not provide frequency response support. Extensive research has been conducted to investigate alternative designs of controllers to facilitate the provision of synthetic inertia and primary frequency response from wind plants. However, frequency response support from wind plants differs from that provided by conventional plants and its impact on the system's economic performance is not yet fully understood. In this context, this paper develops a novel methodology to incorporate the frequency response support from wind plants into generation scheduling, thus enabling the benefits of alternative control strategies to be quantified. Studies are carried out on the future Great Britain power system with different wind energy penetration levels and frequency response requirements. The impact of the uncertainty associated with the quantity of wind plants being online and the energy recovery effect are also analyzed. The results demonstrate that the benefits of frequency response support from wind plants may be significant, although these are system specific. The proposed model could also inform the development of grid codes, market mechanisms, and business cases associated with the frequency response support from wind plants.},

  abstract = {The inertia of today's power system decreases as more and more converter connected generation units and load are integrated in the power system. This results in a power system which behaves differently from before which causes concerns for many grid operators. Therefore, a detailed study is needed to investigate the relevance of this inertia in the operation, control and stability of the system. Moreover, a new definition of the term system inertia is necessary since is it expected that in the future also the renewable electricity generation units will deliver the so-called virtual (synthetic) inertia. In this paper a review of the research related to inertia in a power system is given. Both the challenges as the solutions from an operator point of view to control a system with low inertia are discussed. Also a new definition of inertia is proposed to incorporate the different forms of inertia which are each described in more detail. From recent studies, it can be concluded that the influence of reduced inertia on frequency stability is generally considered as the main challenge for system operators, but with the additional measures listed in this paper, this impact can be mitigated.},

  abstract = {Electricity prices in liberalized markets are determined by the supply and demand for electric power, which are in turn driven by various external influences that vary strongly in time. In perfect competition, the merit order principle describes that dispatchable power plants enter the market in the order of their marginal costs to meet the residual load, i.e.~the difference of load and renewable generation. Various market models are based on this principle when attempting to predict electricity prices, yet the principle is fraught with assumptions and simplifications and thus is limited in accurately predicting prices. In this article, we present an explainable machine learning model for the electricity prices on the German day-ahead market which foregoes of the aforementioned assumptions of the merit order principle. Our model is designed for an ex-post analysis of prices and builds on various external features. Using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values we disentangle the role of the different features and quantify their importance from empiric data, and therein circumvent the limitations inherent to the merit order principle. We show that load, wind and solar generation are the central external features driving prices, as expected, wherein wind generation affects prices more than solar generation. Similarly, fuel prices also highly affect prices, and do so in a nontrivial manner. Moreover, large generation ramps are correlated with high prices due to the limited flexibility of nuclear and lignite plants. Overall, we offer a model that describes the influence of the main drivers of electricity prices in Germany, taking us a step beyond the limited merit order principle in explaining the drivers of electricity prices and their relation to each other.},

In this sense, the energy industry, with its long-standing and varied needs for these services and strong experience, provides a solid test bed for assessing these services. However, it is argued here that, whether for public or commercial use, weather and climate services are, in essence, no different to other more familiar services (e.g. financial). For weather and especially the more recent climate services to succeed, it is therefore important that lessons from these other common services—which also often deal with uncertain and complex information—are considered. It is also natural and important that the burgeoning climate services learn from the more mature and analogous weather services in order to leapfrog development. Initial public investment is critical to spur development of these services. Such investment should then be phased out in a managed way to avoid abruptly interrupting their growth phase and therefore jeopardising their sustainability, given the strong effort that is also being invested into developing these services. The criticalities of the weather and climate services—such as the accuracy and skill of the information—need to be borne in mind when modulating public investment.},

Our study finds that in all three markets the growing wind energy production has not yet significantly increase the magnitude and temporal pattern of net-load ramp, hence potentially rendering a stable or even declining need of operating reserves. The empirical results in this paper support arguments in extant literature that the impact of wind on the operating reserves is more likely related to deviations from normal operation conditions but not for a contingency event. The geographical distribution of wind resources in all three markets could have also helped to reduce the need of additional operating reserves.},

The availability of sufficient operational flexibility is a necessary prerequisite for the effective grid integration of large shares of fluctuating power feed-in from variable RES, especially wind power and Photovoltaics (PV). This paper establishes the necessary framework for quantifying and visualizing the technically available operational flexibility of individual power system units and ensembles thereof. Necessary metrics for defining power system operational flexibility, namely the power ramp-rate, power and energy capability of generators, loads and storage devices, are presented. The flexibility properties of different power system unit types, e.g. load, generation and storage units that are non-controllable, curtailable or fully controllable are qualitatively analyzed and compared to each other. Quantitative results and flexibility visualizations are presented for intuitive power system examples. An outlook for the usage of the here proposed methods in power system control centers is given.},

RES units, notably inverter-connected wind turbines and photovoltaics (PV) that as such do not provide rotational inertia, are effectively displacing conventional generators and their rotating machinery. The traditional assumption that grid inertia is sufficiently high with only small variations over time is thus not valid for power systems with high RES shares. This has implications for frequency dynamics and power system stability and operation. Frequency dynamics are faster in power systems with low rotational inertia, making frequency control and power system operation more challenging. This paper investigates the impact of low rotational inertia on power system stability and operation, contributes new analysis insights and offers impact mitigation options.},

It is a property of matter to remain at rest or uniform motion unless an external force is applied to it. In classical electric power systems, the system frequency is directly coupled to the rotational speed of all rotating equipment directly connected to the grid (as in the cases of synchronous and induction generators, induction motors of big industrial drives, pumps, fans, and so on). Therefore, we can define the inertia of a power system as the resistance of the system to variations in its frequency, which is directly related to the resistance to variations in the angular rotating speed of all of the rotating mass connected to the system. It is then evident that the inertia of the power system is determined by the total rotating inertia directly connected to it.},

Grid-forming inverters are able to operate AC grids with or without rotating machines. In the past, they have been successfully deployed in inverter dominated island grids or in uninterruptable power supply (UPS) systems. It is expected that with increasing shares of inverter-based electrical power generation, grid-forming inverters will also become relevant for interconnected power systems. In contrast to conventional current-controlled inverters, grid-forming inverters do not immediately follow the grid voltage. They form voltage phasors that have an inertial behavior. In consequence, they can inherently deliver momentary reserve and increase power grid resilience.},

What levels of \%NSG can be expected in the future energy scenarios? What are the financial consequences of constraining RES production if the technical capabilities create an upper limit of \%NSG which the system can be operated at?

In several European countries, wind generation is so far not burdened with full balancing responsibility. However, the more wind power penetration, the less bearable for the system not to allocate balancing costs to the responsible parties. Given the variability and limited predictability of wind generation, full balancing exposure is however only feasible conditionally to well-functioning balancing markets. On that account, recommendations ensuring an optimal balancing market design are formulated and their impact on wind generation is assessed. Taking market-based or cost-reflective imbalance prices as the main objective, it is advised that: (1) the imbalance settlement should not contain penalties or power exchange prices, (2) capacity payments should be allocated to imbalanced BRPs via an additive component in the imbalance price and (3) a cap should be imposed on the amount of reserves. Efficient implementation of the proposed market design may require balancing markets being integrated across borders. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The costs and technical implications of thermal plant operating constraints within high renewable electricity systems are receiving growing attention. However, many future scenario modelling studies take limited consideration of such constraints. In this study, different generation portfolios were modelled over a year's dispatch for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), to examine operational impacts and the costs of different power plant operating constraints. As the level of variable renewable energy (VRE) increases, thermal plants are subject to frequent cycling (ramp up/down and start/stop) as they are dispatched to accommodate the outputs of VRE. However, the extent of the operational impact depends on the mix of conventional technologies within the portfolio. Many coal and gas operational constraints were found to be inexpensive, even in a 85\% renewable scenario with primarily wind and solar generation. The combined impact of ramp rate constraints, minimum generation constraints and start-up costs was found to add only 0.1–3\% to total annual system costs. In contrast, a minimum synchronous generation (SG) constraint (intended to maintain minimum levels of system inertia) was found to have a significant impact on system costs when the renewable energy penetration exceeds 40\%, and a moderate cost of greenhouse emissions is assumed. For a renewable share of less than 40\%, the SG requirement has negligible impact since synchronous generators are already supplying at least 40\% of the demand in each dispatch period. A 50\% SG requirement increases total system cost by 20\% in a 85\% renewable portfolio. Similarly, costs are increased by 10\% in a 60\% renewable portfolio. This suggests significant value in investigating measures that minimize the need for a stringent SG constraint in a future carbon constrained world.},

Rotor angle stability is a dynamic phenomenon generally associated with changes in active power flows that create angular separation between synchronous units in the system. With larger penetrations of wind generation being introduced into power systems, there will be large flows of active power from asynchronous generation in the system. These asynchronous active power flows can aid in maintaining the rotor angle stability of the system. However, the manner in which wind generation injects reactive power into the system can be critical in maintaining angular stability of the synchronous units. Utilizing wind generation to control voltage and reactive power in the system can ease the reactive power burden on synchronous generators, and minimize angular separation in the system following a contingency event and can provide a significant level of support which will become increasingly important in future power systems. © 2006 IEEE.},

Moreover, ensuring rational economic behaviour and an efficient and competitive market outcome does not require general access to information at a very detailed level or with a high degree of immediacy. I conclude that to achieve the aims of efficiently functioning wholesale electricity markets, fair and non-discriminatory access to data and a coherent and consistent view of the European wholesale electricity market, it does not seem advisable to go quite so far with respect to immediacy and detail as intended by the new regulations.},

To improve reserve deliverability, event-based zonal STR clearing model and nodal STR clearing model are proposed to distribute reserve across the grid. This paper compares reserve deliverability and market clearing prices between the zonal STR model and the nodal STR model. A new design on penalty function is proposed in this paper to reflect the true value of security constraints for reserve deployment with the consideration of multiple events. Analysis of MISO test cases shows that the zonal approach is imprecise and may not guarantee the actual post-event flows within the physical limits.

  abstract = {Recent studies have concluded that battery energy storage will soon be economically competitive if its cost continues to decline. The authors propose a two-stage look-ahead daily scheduling strategy for distributed energy storage located in distribution networks with a substantial photovoltaic (PV) penetration. They assume that the load serving entity operates this energy storage to harness simultaneously multiple streams of benefits: energy arbitrage, peak shaving, minimising deviations from the load forecast and regulation service. To determine the optimal capacity bid into the day-ahead regulation market and address the price, load, and solar forecast uncertainties, they propose a two-stage optimisation model that bids regulation capacity on the day ahead and determines the storage dispatch schedule in real time. At the day-ahead stage, the load serving entity reserves a portion of the storage capacity for regulation, while the remaining capacity is dispatched for energy arbitrage, peak shaving and minimising the deviations from the forecast. Result suggests that regulation services account for the majority of these benefits. The energy storage is dispatched for peak shaving and forecast-deviation minimisation from around noon to late evening. During the rest of day, storage is dispatched primarily for regulation services.},

  abstract = {As residential battery energy storage systems (BESS) proliferate, it becomes increasingly important to be able to control them optimally within retail electricity market arrangements. Aggressively cycling the battery leads faster degradation and ultimately replacement, which is likely to be uneconomical. Accordingly, battery degradation should be considered in BESS control strategies. This paper uses a linear cost model based on total BESS throughput to incorporate degradation cost into the cost function of an optimal control strategy. This model is chosen due to its practicality in situations where in-depth battery parameters are unknown, real-time dispatch requires fast computation. It is shown that the inclusion of a degradation model has a significant impact on BESS operation under various residential retail tariff structures, suggesting that such models should be included in control strategies. Care is needed to ensure degradation costs are accurate since there is a high sensitivity in these strategies to cost assumptions.},

  abstract = {Australia is facing an ongoing energy crisis, driven by a combination of reduced ‘base-load’ capacity and reliability from an ageing coal-fired power station fleet, as well as the rapid uptake of variable wind and solar generation that has yet to be fully buffered by energy storage. Furthermore, investment in new generating capacity and interstate grid connectivity has not kept pace with thermal power retirements. This is due to policy uncertainty around the future of high CO2 power generation, rising fuel prices, the unviability of nuclear power, and the plummeting cost of clean but variable renewable generation. The resulting national grid is proving to be susceptible to unexpected shocks and high peak spot-pricing, and is only predicted to become more volatile. Unsurprisingly, Australia’s aluminium (Al) smelters are facing immense challenges operating in this environment. As well as potline outages occurring, smelters face an uncertain future when it comes to negotiating base-load contracts at below the cost-of-generation they have historically relied on, as the economics of base-load demand is constantly eroding and being replaced with the need to value flexible electricity consumption. This article examines some of the impacts and explores some of the pathways and opportunities that smelters can use to survive and even prosper, including power modulation and the provision of ‘demand-side response’ services to the national energy grid.},

  abstract = {The demand for minute-scale forecasts of wind power is continuously increasing with the growing penetration of renewable energy into the power grid, as grid operators need to ensure grid stability in the presence of variable power generation. For this reason, IEA Wind Tasks 32 and 36 together organized a workshop on “Very Short-Term Forecasting of Wind Power” in 2018 to discuss different approaches for the implementation of minute-scale forecasts into the power industry. IEA Wind is an international platform for the research community and industry. Task 32 tries to identify and mitigate barriers to the use of lidars in wind energy applications, while IEA Wind Task 36 focuses on improving the value of wind energy forecasts to the wind energy industry. The workshop identified three applications that need minute-scale forecasts: (1) wind turbine and wind farm control, (2) power grid balancing, (3) energy trading and ancillary services. The forecasting horizons for these applications range from around 1 second for turbine control to 60 min for energy market and grid control applications. The methods that can be applied to generate minute-scale forecasts rely on upstream data from remote sensing devices such as scanning lidars or radars, or are based on point measurements from met masts, turbines or profiling remote sensing devices. Upstream data needs to be propagated with advection models and point measurements can either be used in statistical time series models or assimilated into physical models. All methods have advantages but also shortcomings. The workshop’s main conclusions were that there is a need for further investigations into the minute-scale forecasting methods for different use cases, and a cross-disciplinary exchange of different method experts should be established. Additionally, more efforts should be directed towards enhancing quality and reliability of the input measurement data.},

A vital aspect in energy storage planning and operations is to accurately model the aging cost of battery cells, especially in irregular cycling operations. This paper proposes a semi-empirical lithium-ion battery degradation model that assesses battery cell life loss from operating profiles. We formulate the model by combining fundamental theories of battery degradation and our observations in battery aging test results. The model is adaptable to different types of lithium-ion batteries, and methods for tuning the model coefficients based on manufacturer’s data are presented. A cycle-counting method is incorporated to identify stress cycles from irregular operations, allowing the degradation model to be applied to any battery energy storage (BES) applications. The usefulness of this model is demonstrated through an assessment of the degradation that a BES would incur by providing frequency control in the PJM regulation market.},

Additionally, power electronic converters are widely adopted and needed in the PV power conversion and should be efficient, reliable, and cost-effective. To achieve these objectives, advanced control approaches should also be developed, and as a prerequisite, the modeling of the entire system is required.

This conversion is called rectification and this chapter models single-phase AC/DC converters from the simplest diode rectifiers to controllable AC/DC converters. Then, the control strategies will be discussed with a focus on improving the power quality at the AC side, e.g., using a single-phase power factor correction control. Additionally, this chapter overviews the phase-locked loop synchronization techniques for single-phase AC/DC conversion systems, which are also applicable to single-phase DC/AC inversion systems.

  abstract = {Incorporating Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) into renewable energy systems offers clear potential benefits, but management approaches that optimally operate the system are required to fully realise these benefits. There exist many strategies and techniques for optimising the operation of BESS in renewable systems, with the desired outcomes ranging from specific dispatch aims to targets that cover financial, technical or hybrid objectives. The optimisation techniques employed can be grouped into three main categories; directed searchbased methods; probabilistic methods; and rule-based strategies. A key focus of past studies has been specific renewable energy systems with targeted applications, such as large scale, or distributed generation. This review, whilst providing a comprehensive summary of battery management approaches, analyses these studies in terms of linking the application purpose and the optimisation technique employed. This approach means correlations between specific optimisation targets and preferred optimisation techniques can be identified. It is found that financial objective optimisations are more likely to be solved by directed search-based methods, and control strategies applied for technical objective optimisations. The choice of solution technique is also shown to strongly depend on how well the problem is formulated mathematically. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the reported optimisation techniques are compared leading to the conclusion that hybrid approaches, combining advantages from different approaches, will play an increasing role in the future operation strategy development. In addition to a state-of-the-art review of battery applications and optimisation techniques, this review should help researchers quickly identify suitable optimisation techniques for new generation applications.},

  abstract = {Large-scale battery storage solutions have received wide interest as being one of the options to promote renewable energy (RE) penetration. The profitability of battery storages is affected by the bidding strategy adopted by the operator and is highly dependent on the operation of the rest of the energy system. Nevertheless, the coordination between the battery and the energy system has not been investigated in the literature yet. This paper provides a holistic hourly techno-economic analysis of the bidding strategies of large-scale Li-ion batteries in 100\% renewable smart energy systems. As a case study, the 2050 Danish energy system is used to demonstrate the relationship between large-scale battery systems and the rest of the energy system. The results show that large-scale battery storage plays a limited role in future energy systems that follow the smart energy system concept. Likewise, the battery solution is only economically feasible in the Danish smart energy system at low battery storage capacities (few hours’ duration) with a low-profit margin rate (approx. 100\%) and a short prognostic period (approx. 12~h) for operation planning. The finding of this study provides the general strategies of the battery bidding and operation in 100\% RE systems.},

  abstract = {Storage is expected to be a critical source of firming in low-carbon grids. A common concern raised from ex-post assessments is that storage resources can fail to respond to strong price signals during times of scarcity. While commonly attributed to forecast error or failures in operations, we posit that this behavior can be explained from the perspective of riskaverse scheduling. Using a stochastic self-scheduling framework and real-world data harvested from the Australian National Electricity Market, we demonstrate that risk-averse storage resources tend to have a myopic operational perspective, that is, they typically engage in near-term price arbitrage and chase only few extreme price spikes and troughs, thus remaining idle in several time periods with markedly high and low prices. This has important policy implications given the non-transparency of unit risk aversion and apparent risk in intervention decision-making.},

  abstract = {Since wind turbines or photovoltaic (PV) panels are generally connected to the power grid by power electronic inverters, the power system inertia is gradually decreasing along with the growing share of renewable energy. This jeopardizes the system frequency response dynamics so that the corresponding frequency security issue is becoming the bottle-neck factor that restricts the development of high renewable energy penetration. Consequently, power system scheduling models need to incorporate frequency dynamics. The difficulty lies in how to formulate the frequency security constraints from the perspective of hourly load-generation balance since the frequency dynamics have a shorter time scale (5\textasciitilde 30 s). Several modeling methods have been proposed based on different assumptions and simplifications. However, their accuracy is not clear. We first propose a novel method to formulate linear frequency security constraints, which considers more details of frequency response dynamics. Then, an evaluation methodology is designed to quantify the accuracy of those frequency constraints. Using this evaluation method, we compare two typical methods in recent literature with the proposed method. The results show the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.},

The existing research on flexibility uses different techniques to study flexibility property from different aspects. While studying a property from various viewpoints increases the understanding on the subject, we need a consistent theoretical framework to consolidate the ideas generated in the field, compare and contrast results, and build on for future analysis. Based on the insights of the nature of flexibility, this paper proposes a unified framework for defining and measuring flexibility in power system. Under the proposed framework, we propose a flexibility metric which evaluates the largest variation range of uncertainty that the system can accommodate. Such a metric takes into account transmission network and system operations constraints, which are critical to assessing flexibility, but are often ignored in literature. A robust optimization technique is used to calculate the proposed metrics. While the illustrative example presented in this paper focuses on the flexibility in real-time system operation in the presence of wind and load uncertainty, this framework can generally be applicable to long-term studies such as system planning.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, a mathematical model of the power circuit of a three-phase AC/DC converter is developed in the stationary and synchronous reference frames. Then, the operation principle of the phasor locked loop is addressed to exact the angle information of the power grid to realize the accurate control synchronized with the power grid. Afterward, based on the modeling of the three-phase grid-tied converter, the controller design of the PI (Proportion + Integral) and PR (Proportion + Resonant) is implemented under the synchronous reference frame and stationary reference frame, respectively. It is realized by the desired bandwidth and its corresponding phase margin with the aid of Bode plot. It is simulation proven that the step response of the inner grid current and outer DC voltage matches their desired bandwidth.},

  abstract = {In addition to providing energy to end-consumers, power system operators are also responsible for ensuring system reliability. To this end, power markets maintain an array of ancillary services to ensure that it is always possible to balance the supply and demand for energy in real-time. A subset of these ancillary services are commonly procured through market-based mechanisms: namely, Regulation, Spinning, and Non-spinning Reserves. Regulation Reserves are maintained to respond to supply/demand imbalances over short time frames, typically on the order of several seconds to one minute. Resources that provide Regulation Reserves adjust their generation or load levels in response to automatic generation control (AGC) signals provided by the system operator. Contingency reserves are maintained to provide additional generation capacity in the event that load increases substantially or supply side resources reduce their output or are taken offline. The reserves are typically segmented into two categories, 1) Spinning or Synchronized Reserves that are provided by generation units that are actively generating and have the ability to increase or decrease their output, 2) Non-spinning or Non-synchronized Reserves that are provided by generation resources that are not actively generating, but are able to start up and provide generation within a specified timeframe. Contingency reserves typically have response times on the order of ten to 30 minutes and can also be provided by demand-side resources that are capable of reducing their load. There are seven distinct power markets in the United States, each operated by a Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) or Independent System Operator (ISO) that operates the transmission system in its territory, operates markets for energy and ancillary services, and maintains system reliability. Each power market offers its own set of ancillary services, and precise definitions, requirements, and market mechanisms differ between markets. Despite the differences between markets, both in terms of services offered and system requirements, some broad trends generally apply. Regulation Reserves typically have the highest market prices, followed by Spinning Reserves and Non-spinning Reserves. Prices for Regulation Reserves have been the highest in the PJM market, since it opened in October 2012. This is partially because PJM experienced large price spikes during the period of extreme weather conditions in early 2014. ERCOT has traditionally had the highest prices for Spinning Reserves (called Responsive Reserves in ERCOT), including several periods of sustained high prices between 2010 and 2012. This can be explained in part by the relatively high penetration of variable wind resources and a similarly high requirement relative to peak load. ERCOT has also traditionally had the highest price for Non-spinning Reserves, followed by the NYISO East region. Both have experienced several periods of prolonged high prices since their inception, an occurrence that has not been regularly seen in other markets. In ISO-NE and PJM for example, the market clearing price for Non-spinning Reserves is typically \$0/MWh more than 95\% of the time. Market volume (in terms of the average amount of capacity of each service that is provided to a system) typically follows the reverse order of prices, as systems maintain the most Non-spinning Reserves capacity followed by Spinning Reserves and Regulation Reserves. PJM generally has the largest market for Regulation Reserves both in terms of capacity. The size of most Regulation Reserves markets in terms of capacity stay relatively constant year-to-year, as this is dictated largely by system requirements. PJM also generally has the largest Spinning Reserves market in terms of capacity. SPP, MISO, ISO-NE and SPP (beginning in 2014) all have Spinning Reserve markets with similar average capacity levels. When combined, the markets for Non-spinning and Operating reserves in ISO-NE have a comparable capacity to the market for Primary Reserves1 in PJM. SPP, MISO, and CAISO all have smaller markets for their respective Non-spinning Reserves products that are roughly the same size as each other in terms of capacity.},
