This is a brief outline of what went into each chapter, and a section which shows how to reference headers (which are labelled automatically for you). This chapter, @sec:intro, shows how to use citations and how to reference section headers. @sec:lit_review shows how use and reference equations. @sec:fcs is the FCAS  paper. @sec:second shows how to use, reference, and resize pdf and jpg figures. @sec:reserves shows how to use and reference tables. @sec:fourth is truly revolutionary (but shows nothing functional). **[Appendix 1](#appendix-1-some-extra-stuff)** shows how to add chapters which are not numbered, and has to be referenced manually, as does **[Appendix 2](#appendix-2-some-more-extra-stuff)**.
