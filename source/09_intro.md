## Context and motivation

Mitigation of the wide-ranging, adverse impacts of climate change on ecological and human systems requires reducing and eventually halting global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, of which largest source is the electricity sector [@portnerIPCC2022Climate2022; @internationalenergyagencyNetZero20502021]. Decarbonisation demands an unprecedented deployment of renewable energy, storage and transmission to not only to replace emissions-intensive electricity generated from burning fossil fuels, but also to meet projected increases in the demand for electricity driven by economic development and electrification [@internationalrenewableenergyagencyGlobalRenewablesOutlook2020]. Fortunately, investment in the energy transition is being bolstered by two reinforcing forces: greater direct investment or support from policy-makers for low-carbon technologies and enablers, and declining technology and deployment costs – particularly for solar photovoltaic modules and lithium-ion batteries – achieved through experiential learning that has been accelerated by device modularity [@wayEmpiricallyGroundedTechnology2022; @roquesEvolutionEuropeanModel2021a; @joskowHierarchiesMarketsPartially2022].

Consequently, power systems are currently experiencing or soon expected to experience high instantaneous penetrations of variable renewable energy (VRE), of which solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind generation are the most prevalent forms [@australianenergymarketoperatorMaintainingPowerSystem2019; @matevosyanFutureInverterBasedResources2021]. The inherent variability, uncertainty and, in the case of inverter-based resources, asynchronicity of VRE can be problematic for balancing power systems – ensuring that active power supply and demand are more or less equal at each moment – that were originally designed to accommodate conventional (thermal and hydroelectric) generation [@elaOperatingReservesVariable2011; @kenyonStabilityControlPower2020]. Nonetheless, modelling has indicated that 100% renewable power systems can feasibly be balanced [@hansenStatusPerspectives1002019; @ellistonLeastCost1002013; @rey-costaFirming100Renewable2023], though a key assumption of these studies is that operational practices are appropriately configured to incentivise, control and/or coordinate power system resources to ensure that sufficient balancing flexibility is made available to the system. This task – designing and configuring operational practices to ensure successful balancing of high VRE power systems – remains a significant and ongoing challenge, necessitating the reassessment of grid codes, system operator processes and, most critically, electricity market design in jurisdictions that have introduced competition at the wholesale level [@papaefthymiou100RenewableEnergy2016].

In this thesis, I explore how policy-makers should design or, at the very least, approach the design of operational practices for balancing electricity markets given existing challenges and those posed by growing penetrations of VRE. I do so within the context of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), which refers to both the power system and electricity market that service ~80% of the country's electricity consumption [@departmentofclimatechangeenergytheenvironmentandwaterNationalElectricityMarket2023].

## Research gap

Whilst there is some degree of international consensus on high-level outcomes and the priority areas for designing operational balancing practices for electricity markets with growing penetrations of renewable energy, the multi-layered nature of the design problem, the presence of existing tensions and challenges, and a changing resource mix mean that the design process is complex and contested. Previous literature has emphasised the need for empirical research to identify feasible, flexible and contextually appropriate solutions, even if they may not be optimal. Through empirical studies of aspects of the Australian NEM, this thesis endeavours to address this knowledge gap in the Australian context. It also seeks to provide policy-makers in other jurisdictions with valuable insights drawn from the Australian experience and serve as a model for approaching context-specific design when evaluating the merit of operational practices in balancing electricity markets undergoing transition.

## Thesis research question and objectives

The **research question** of this thesis is outlined below:

> *Given existing design challenges and increasing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources as energy transition proceeds, how should we design or, at the very least, approach the design of operational practices for balancing electricity markets?*

I focus on two aspects of this question that are encompassed by the following research **objectives**:

1. *To determine what features are needed in centrally-coordinated arrangements for procuring frequency control services during energy transition.*

2. *To better understand how the capabilities and deployability of balancing flexibility in scheduling timeframes are changing during energy transition, and whether these changes impact the suitability of more decentralised operational balancing practices.*

I attempt to achieve these objectives through the following three research **methods**:

1. Reviews of academic and industry literature on the design of operational balancing practices from the Australian NEM and other jurisdictions.
2. Analysis of system and market data from the Australian NEM to provide empirical evidence for techno-economic modelling assumptions and to support the discussion of policy options.
3. Techno-economic (market) optimisation modelling. This includes the modelling of market regions of the NEM, and of market participation schedules for battery energy storage systems engaged in energy arbitrage.

The links between the research question, the research objectives and the research questions are shown in [@fig:research_framework] and are discussed in greater detail in [Chapter @sec:research_framework].
