## Context and motivation

TODO: Fix Handbook citation

Mitigation of the wide-ranging and adverse impacts of climate change on ecological and human systems requires reducing and eventually halting global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, of which largest source is the electricity sector [@portnerIPCC2022Climate2022; @internationalenergyagencyNetZero20502021]. Reducing emissions requires an unprecedented deployment of renewable energy, storage and transmission â€“ not only to replace emissions-intensive fossil fuel generation, but also to meet projected increases in the demand for electricity driven by economic development  and electrification [@internationalrenewableenergyagencyGlobalRenewablesOutlook2020]. Fortunately, investment in the energy transition is being buoyed by two reinforcing forces: increasing direct investment or investment support from policy-makers for low-carbon technologies and enablers, and technology and deployment cost declines that accompany increasing deployment (to date, these have been significant for solar photovolatic panels and lithium-ion battery energy storage) [@wayEmpiricallyGroundedTechnology2021; @joskowHierarchiesMarketsPartially2022; @glachantHandbookElectricityMarkets2021].

## Structure of the thesis

Explain what's in each of the chapters

This is a brief outline of what went into each chapter, and a section which shows how to reference headers (which are labelled automatically for you). This chapter, [Chapter @sec:intro], is the introduction. [Chapter @sec:lit_review] is the literature review. [Chapter @sec:fcs] is the FCAS  paper. [Chapter @sec:reserves] is the reserves paper. [Chapter @sec:info] is the information and storage paper. [Appendix @sec:appendix-reserves_assumptions] outlines the assumptions for the modelling in [Chapter @sec:reserves]. [Appendix @sec:appendix-milps] presents the mixed-integer linear program formulations used in the storage modelling in [Chapter @sec:info], and [Appendix @sec:appendix-discounting] describes the methodology used to model a storage scheduler discounting price forecasts (one of the formulations used in the storage modelling in [Chapter @sec:info] and described in [Appendix @sec:appendix-milps]).
