Explain what's in each of the chapters

This is a brief outline of what went into each chapter, and a section which shows how to reference headers (which are labelled automatically for you). This chapter, [Chapter @sec:intro], is the introduction. [Chapter @sec:lit_review] is the literature review. [Chapter @sec:fcs] is the FCAS  paper. [Chapter @sec:reserves] is the reserves paper. [Chapter @sec:info] is the information and storage paper. [Appendix @sec:appendix-reserves_assumptions] outlines the assumptions for the modelling in [Chapter @sec:reserves]. [Appendix @sec:appendix-milps] presents the mixed-integer linear program formulations used in the storage modelling in [Chapter @sec:info], and [Appendix @sec:appendix-discounting] describes the methodology used to model a storage scheduler discounting price forecasts (one of the formulations used in the storage modelling in [Chapter @sec:info] and described in [Appendix @sec:appendix-milps]).
