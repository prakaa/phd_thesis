# Context and literature review {#sec:lit_review}

## Introduction

In this chapter, I provide useful context and a brief overview of the literature that tackles the challenge of designing operational practices in electricity markets with growing penetrations of variable renewable energy (VRE). Whilst the literature has identified high-level design outcomes and the design areas that deserve the most attention as energy transition proceeds, the review highlights a role for empirical work that identifies "second-best" and flexible design solutions given the specific context of each power system and jurisdiction. This approach to designing operational balancing practices constitutes a knowledge gap that we aim to address in the Australian context within this thesis (see [@sec:research_framework], the research framework for this thesis).

The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. Firstly, I present a brief overview of power systems in [@sec:lit_review-power_systems]. I then discuss the importance of active power balancing in operational timeframes and provide a summary of the main paradigms under which power systems are operated in [@sec:lit_review-operations]. Following this, in [@sec:lit_review-balancing_practices], I describe existing and emerging balancing practices in operational timeframes, and in [@sec:lit_review-design], I propose good design outcomes and discuss the challenges involved in operational practice design. Finally, in [@sec:lit_review-gap], I summarise the motivation for the work contained within this thesis.

In this chapter, I use **bold text** to indicate that a (new) term or concept being is defined.

## Power systems {#sec:lit_review-power_systems}
 
Given the welfare and economic benefits associated with electricity access, many states in the 20^th^ century constructed bulk power systems to leverage investment and operational economies of scale. These systems sought to efficiently deliver **active power** (the component of apparent power that does work at a load) to numerous electricity end-users (in the aggregate, system **demand** or **load**) from electricity suppliers (**generators**) across vast distances. A typical power system configuration is presented in [@fig:elec_supply_chain]. Generators supply the system with alternating current (AC) power either through a direct electromagnetic connection or, if they are inverter-based resources (IBRs)[^1], through a power electronic **inverter** interface that converts the direct current (DC) power produced by the generator to AC power. AC power is then transmitted over long distances through a high voltage transmission system. As transmission lines approach load centres, voltages are stepped down to make power delivery to the majority of end-users connected to the lower voltage distribution system safer [@mastersRenewableEfficientElectric2004].

[^1]: These include VRE IBRs (solar PV and Type III and Type IV wind turbines), battery energy storage systems and voltage sourcec converter high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines [@achillesIntegratingInverterBasedResources2017; @machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020].

### Synchronous and control areas

A network area that is operated at a (constant) nominal AC frequency is known as a **synchronous area**. During normal operation, AC frequency should be close to the system's nominal value and more or less uniform across the synchronous area (see @sec:lit_review-balancing_need as to why). A **control area**, on the other hand, is a network area which a particular **system operator** (SO) is responsible for operating. In this thesis, I use the term **jurisdiction** interchangeably with control area, with a preference for the former when referring to a control area with a wholesale electricity market overlay.

Whether the term "power system" refers to a synchronous area or a control area is dependent on context and the relationship between the two in the jurisdiction in question. In eastern and southern Australia, the National Electricity Market's (NEM) single control area consists of two synchronous areas (see [@sec:fcs-nem] for further detail). In contrast, other jurisdictions have a single synchronous area composed of several electrically-connected control areas demarcated by political, rather than physical boundaries. For example, continental Europe is a single synchronous area consisting of many national or trans-national control areas, and the continental United States has three synchronous areas (two of which extend into Canada) with over 60 control areas [@schittekatteDistributedEnergyResources2022; @northamericanelectricreliabilitycorporationNERCInterconnections2023].

## Power system operations {#sec:lit_review-operations}

In broad terms, operating a power system involves the direction or control of **power system resources** — generators, loads, network elements and energy storage resources. In practice, power system operation is an economic optimisation problem that aims to minimise system costs (or under some market paradigms, maximise the value of trade) whilst 1) continuously maintaining a balance between active power supply and demand, and 2) ensuring that system resources and the system itself are operated within their respective technical envelopes [@woodPowerGenerationOperation2014]. The former constraint more or less corresponds to **reliable** operation[^2], and the latter constraint implies **secure** (or **stable**) operation and is a prerequisite for reliable operation [@anderssonPowerSystemSecurity2021]. Maintaining a secure and reliable power system is vital; restarting the system after failure (system restoration) is a long and complex procedure, and power outages (**blackouts**), whether they be localised or across a wider area, can have devastating social and economic consequences [@kirschenFundamentalsPowerSystem2004].

[^2]: In many jurisdictions, reliability is actually defined as the ability of generation to supply load requirements to an administratively-set standard. This standard varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

[@fig:power_system_timeframes] presents a high-level overview of power system phenomena in operational timeframes and common operational practices (i.e. processes, services and markets in operational timeframes). The processes, services and markets discussed in detail within this thesis are highlighted in bold red text. Though I do not discuss processes, services and markets in investment and planning timeframes in great detail in this thesis, it is worth acknowledging that they have a bearing on the manner in which a power system is operated. In some cases, the inverse is also true.

### Phenomena in operational timeframes

A knowledge of power system phenomena and the timescales in which they occur is crucial to the successful operation of a power system. As shown in @fig:power_system_timeframes, power system operations is concerned with phenomena that dominate on timescales ranging from a few milliseconds to several months [@hatziargyriouDefinitionClassificationPower2021; @machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020]:

1.  *Electromagnetic* phenomena arise from the coupling of electrical and magnetic fields within **synchronous machines** (generators and motors that rotate at a speed proportional to AC frequency) and between power system resources. They occur on the timescale of milliseconds to seconds. IBR controls also operate in this timeframe.

2.  *Electromechanical* phenomena are slower (seconds to minutes timescale) and arise as a result of electromagnetic fields interacting with rotating masses and mechanical forces. These typically occur in generators and motors.

3.  *Thermodynamic* phenomena are slower still. They encompass chemical fuel conversion and heat transfer processes in boilers. These phenomena occur over multiple timescales, from seconds to minutes to hours. The dynamics of the primary energy sources for hydroelectricity and VRE are also relevant in these timescales [@keeratimahatAnalysisShorttermOperational2021].

### Active power balancing {#sec:lit_review-balancing}

**Active power balancing** can be described in simple terms using the law of conservation of energy: the energy supplied into a network node through primary energy conversion, energy storage or transmission is equal to the sum of the energy dissipated, stored and consumed at the same network node at each and every moment. However, the engineering reality is that active power balancing requires *real-time* control of generation and loads to balance active power supply and demand *across the power system*. *Real-time* (i.e. moment-to-moment) control of supply and demand is required because it is still uneconomical in many jurisdictions to store electricity at scale despite grid-scale storage cost reductions [@internationalenergyagencyGridScaleStorage2022]. In other words, many power systems have small balancing buffers and thus require real-time balancing. Furthermore, though electricity can be transported close to the speed of light across a synchronous area, balancing requires at least some degree of coordination *across the power system*. There are two reasons behind this. Firstly, active power imbalances can have system-wide consequences (see [@sec:lit_review-balancing_need]). Secondly, transmission losses and various network constraints imposed by line thermal limits, stability requirements and Kirchoff's circuit laws necessitate the coordination of power flows required for system balancing [@kirschenFundamentalsPowerSystem2004; @hirthWhyWindNot2016a].

#### Why is balancing required? {#sec:lit_review-balancing_need}

Unlike the transportation networks of many other commodities, an active power supply-demand imbalance can lead to deviations in technical parameters – voltage and AC frequency – that not only have the potential to damage equipment connected to the power system, but also to trigger a system collapse [@borensteinEconomicsElectricityReliability2023].

##### The relationship between active power balance and AC frequency {#sec:lit_review-balancing_need-frequency}

The presence of synchronous machines in most power systems means that system active power balance is closely tied to the system's AC frequency. During stable operation, synchronous machines rotate at a **synchronous speed** ($N_s$) that is proportional to the power system frequency ($f$) ([@eq:synch_speed]) [@chapmanElectricMachineryFundamentals2011]:

$$N_s = \frac{120f}{P}$$ {#eq:synch_speed}

where $N_s$ is the synchronous speed in revolutions per minute, $P$ is the number of (rotor) magnetic poles and $f$ is the electrical frequency in Hertz (Hz).

We can see the link between active power balance and power system frequency by examining synchronous machine dynamics. In a synchronous generator (coal-fired, gas-fired and hydro generators), the interaction between the magnetic fields of the rotor and stator produces an electromagnetic torque ($T_e$) on the rotor that opposes the mechanical torque ($T_m$) supplied by a prime mover (e.g. steam turbine) ([@fig:synch_torques]). [@eq:swing], which is a variation of what is known as the swing equation, shows that if there is a transient increase in the electrical load of the power system (equivalent to an increase in $P_e$ and thus $T_e$), the rotor of a synchronous generator will begin to decelerate as its stored kinetic energy is converted to electrical energy [@graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994; @elgerdElectricEnergySystems1971].

$$J\omega_{sm}\frac{d\omega_{sm}}{dt} = P_m - P_e$$ {#eq:swing}

where $\omega_{sm}$ is the synchronous machine rotor shaft velocity, $J$ is moment of inertia of the rotor, $P_m$ is mechanical power, $T_m$ is mechanical torque, $P_e$ is electrical power and $T_e$ is electromagnetic torque.

![Mechanical power applied to the prime mover results in a mechanical torque $T_m$ on the rotor of a synchronous generator. This is opposed by an electromagnetic torque $T_e$ that is produced from the interaction between the rotor and stator magnetic fields. Source: @reboursComprehensiveAssessmentMarkets2009](source/figures/swing.png){#fig:synch_torques short-caption="Mechanical and electromagnetic torques on a synchronous generator" width="60%"}

The relationship between the active power imbalance in a power system ($P_{gen}-P_{load}$) and AC frequency is obtained by extending the dynamics of the swing equation from a single synchronous generator to all synchronous generators in a synchronous area ([@eq:swing_area]). [@eq:swing_area] shows that the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) is proportional to the active power imbalance and inversely proportional to the system's inertia constant, $H$. This form of the swing equation only models the **inertial response** of synchronous generators; that is, it does not include the load damping response offered by (frequency-dependent) induction motor loads. The generation inertia constant is often used a proxy for the system inertia constant since the high speed and mass of generator rotors mean that they store significant quantities of kinetic energy [@ulbigImpactLowRotational2014; @denholmInertiaPowerGrid2020].

$$\frac{2H}{f}\frac{df}{dt} = \frac{P_{gen}-P_{load}}{S_{g, total}}$$ {#eq:swing_area}

where $H$ is the inertia constant of the synchronous area ($H=\sum_{g} H_g$, where $H_g = \frac{J_g(2\pi f)^2}{2S_g}$), $f$ is the AC frequency, $\frac{df}{dt}$ is the rate of change of frequency or RoCoF, $S_{g,total}$ is the total apparent power of synchronous generators, and $P_{gen}$ and $P_{load}$ are the power system's total active power supply and total active power demand (including losses), respectively.

[@eq:swing_area] shows that a power system's AC frequency is an indicator of active power balance [@bagginiHandbookPowerQuality2008]. Insufficient generation will lead to a *decrease* in system frequency (i.e. negative RoCoF) and oversupply will lead to an *increase* in system frequency (i.e. positive RoCoF).

##### The consequences of frequency deviations {#sec:lit_review-balancing_need-consequences}

Serious power system frequency deviations away from the nominal value can have harmful effects. Synchronous machines may experience equipment-damaging vibrations [@ulbigImpactLowRotational2014], and both synchronous machines and transformers can overheat and fail if they operate outside their rated voltage-frequency limits [@kirbyFrequencyControlConcerns2002]. Synchronous machines are also vulnerable to damage from high RoCoFs due to pole slipping [@dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016]. For these reasons, frequency-sensitive relays are often used to protect power system resources from frequency excursions.

However, these same equipment protection measures can also trigger the complete collapse of the power system. Should the disconnection of a resource following a relay trip exacerbate an existing active power imbalance, the system frequency may deviate further and result in further disconnections. Situations such as these are known as **cascading failures** and can lead to the collapse of the entire power system. As such, SOs often employ emergency frequency control schemes to arrest imbalances by tripping loads in the event of under-frequency (under-frequency load shedding or **UFLS**) or generation in the event of over-frequency (over-frequency generation shedding or **OFGS**) [@australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021; @hartmannEffectsDecreasingSynchronous2019]. The activation of these schemes is undesirable; UFLS adversely affects power system reliability and both are intended to be a last line of defence against frequency-driven system collapse.

#### Threats to active power balance {#sec:lit_review-balancing_threats}

Threats to active power balance can be broadly categorised as either power system **variability** or power system **uncertainty**.

##### Power system variability

Power system variability refers to *expected* or forecasted changes to active power supply and/or demand. Sources of variability include fluctuations in load, oscillatory active power output from synchronous generators and VRE generation **ramping** (i.e. a sustained increase or decrease in active power output), which includes changes in solar PV generation during sunrise or sunset and in wind generation with wind speed variations [@elaOperatingReservesVariable2011; @australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020; @bloomItIndisputableFive2017].

##### Power system uncertainty

Power system uncertainty refers to *unexpected* changes to active power supply and/or demand. These can be further categorised as "known unknowns" and "unknown unknowns". Source of uncertainty include demand and VRE generation forecast errors, and singular or widespread outage events triggered by the weather or unexpected system responses and interactions.  [@australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020; @elaOperatingReservesVariable2011; @egglestonSecurityResilienceTechnical2021].

### Operational paradigms {#sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms}

Given the need for at least some degree of balancing coordination in a power system, SOs are ultimately responsible for ensuring that their control area is operated in a secure and reliable manner [@roquesMarketDesignGeneration2008]. Though the powers, responsibilities and degree of ring-fencing imposed upon the SO vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, these are largely dictated by the control area's operational paradigm [@chawlaGlobalTrendsElectricity2013]. Below, I discuss the two possible operational paradigms: where the SO is a **vertically-integrated utility**, and where the SO is, at the very least, responsible for operating a transmission system that forms the physical basis of a **wholesale electricity market**.

#### Vertically-integrated utility

Under this paradigm, a single company (either state-owned or privately-owned but regulated) owns, operates and invests in generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as being responsible for the retail of electricity to the end-user. This was the sole operational paradigm for much of the 20^th^ century. Having a single owner and operator of power system resources reduces complexity and transaction costs, and enables economies of scale in both asset investment (particularly generation infrastructure) and operation  [@sioshansiElectricityMarketReform2006]. The benefits from economies of scale are material  where industrialisation and/or electrification are driving sustained load growth. This was the case in advanced economies in the 20^th^ century and is still the case in many emerging economies [@roquesAdaptingElectricityMarkets2017; @hoganElectricityMarketStructure2008].

#### Wholesale electricity markets

Beginning in the late 1980s, some jurisdictions opted to **restructure** their electricity sector. To varying degrees across different jurisdictions, the impetuses for restructuring included advancements in small low-upfront cost gas turbine technologies, the promise of consumer choice, perceptions that vertically-integrated utilities were inefficient and politicised, and a political zeitgeist prevalent at the time that pursued economic efficiency through privatisation and competition [@sioshansiElectricityMarketReform2006; @macgillElectricityIndustryReform2013; @simshauserLessonsAustraliaNational2019; @chesterEnergyProblemRepresentation2019]. Two features common to electricity industry restructuring processes were the unbundling of vertically-integrated utilities and the introduction of competition for wholesale supply (and in some cases, demand) via an **electricity market** (an auction-based mechanism for the sale and/or purchase of electricity).

##### Unbundling

In most cases, the unbundling of a vertically-integrated utility divided generation ownership, and made the SO responsible for the secure and reliable operation of the transmission network whilst barring them from owning generation assets. In some jurisdictions, SOs were also given ownership of the transmission network (e.g. Transmission System Operators, or TSOs, in many European control areas) whereas others made their SOs "independent" by relieving them of any asset ownership (e.g. Independent System Operators in North American control areas). Some SOs, such as those in North America and the Australian NEM, were also given market operation responsibilities [@chawlaGlobalTrendsElectricity2013].

##### Market models

Much like the diverse outcomes of unbundling, the design and implementation of wholesale electricity markets differs across jurisdictions that undertook electricity industry restructuring. Despite these differences, electricity markets worldwide can broadly be categorised into two markets models[^3] that are distinguished by the degree of centralisation in system and market operations [@barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005; @cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017; @ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022]:

[^3]: My descriptions of central and self-dispatch electricity markets differ slightly to those of @ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022, who focus on the level of centralisation in day-ahead timeframes. They categorise the Australian NEM as a decentralised market as participants manage self-commitment; however, the SO still produces resource-specific production and consumption targets through a central dispatch process that also clears the real-time market. Refer to [@sec:info-context-nem] for more detail.

1.  **Central dispatch** markets, where decisions regarding dispatch and, in some cases, unit commitment (see [@sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-scheduling]) are made by the SO. System and market operations are often **integrated** (i.e. the SO is also the market operator) through the creation of a **mandatory power pool**, in which supply offers are aggregated and cleared against a demand forecast (one-sided pool) or against an aggregated demand curve constructed from potential buyers (two-sided pool) [@barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005]. In these markets, locational prices for energy and **ancillary services** (services procured to maintain security and reliability) are produced by SO-run centralised optimisation processes that consider the physical constraints of the transmission system. This market model has been adopted in Independent System Operator/Regional Transmission Operator (ISO/RTO) markets in North America (refer to @sec:fcs-NA for more detail) and, as I discuss further in [@sec:info-context-nem], the Australian NEM's design is predominantly based on this model (though it does incorporate some features of more decentralised markets).

2.  Decentralised or **self-dispatch** markets, where decisions regarding dispatch and unit commitment are made by market participants, and in which system and market operations are more decoupled. These types of markets facilitate trade through bilateral contracts between suppliers and buyers. Whilst scheduling and dispatch is managed by market participants, they are required to submit intended schedules to the SO ahead of delivery (often during the day-ahead). The SO is responsible for taking redispatch actions to ensure that transmission constraints are not violated, and for determining the requirement for and procuring balancing services (another name for frequency control services, which I discuss in greater detail in [@sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-fcs]) that maintain system balance following market gate closure. As outlined in @sec:fcs-EU, this is the dominant market model in Europe.

@fig:market_models shows the primary and secondary commercial arrangements in each of these market models. A mandatory power pool is the primary exchange mechanism in central dispatch markets, whereas self-dispatch markets are designed to facilitate exchange through bilateral contracts. However, both exchange mechanisms are present in each market model. Bilateral contracts (in the form of derivatives) are often used as hedging instruments in central dispatch markets, and several self-dispatch markets, such as those in Europe, have associated voluntary power exchanges that are essentially power pools [@barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005].

![Primary and secondary commercial arrangements in central and self-dispatch electricity markets. Reproduced from @barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005.](source/figures/market_models.pdf){#fig:market_models short-caption="Primary and secondary commercial arrangements in central and self-dispatch electricity markets"}

##### Market platforms {#sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms-markets-platforms}

Power system resource inflexibilities and the desire for physical and financial risk management mechanisms in operational timeframes have driven policy-makers in many jurisdictions to design and implement electricity markets with multiple market **platforms** [@energysecurityboardSystemServicesAhead2020; @isemongerBenefitsRisksVirtual2006]. Platforms are formal sub-markets for energy (and sometimes ancillary services) that are predominantly cleared ahead of the delivery of electricity and/or ancillary services. The number of platforms implemented in a particular market is often related to its market model. Self-dispatch markets can maximise trade and better facilitate market participants balancing their positions by implementing multiple market platforms (typically day-ahead and several intra-day) (see [@sec:fcs-EU]), whereas the number of platforms in central dispatch markets (typically real-time and in most cases, day-ahead) is limited by the computational complexity of the optimisation algorithm(s) used by the SO to clear each market platform (see [@sec:fcs-NA] and [@sec:fcs-nem]) [@ahlqvistCentralSelfDispatchElectricity2018].

## Balancing practices in operational timeframes {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices}

SOs employ **balancing practices** in operational timeframes (which include the processes, services and markets shown in @fig:power_system_timeframes) to obtain **balancing flexibility**. Balancing flexibility is procured either to directly address variability, or as optionality to mange uncertainty [@heggartyQuantifyingPowerSystem2020; @heggartyQuantifyingPowerSystem2020; @papaefthymiou100RenewableEnergy2016]. Though the particularities of these practices vary between jurisdictions, they are almost always organised in a hierarchical and sequential fashion to ensure that active power supply and demand are continuously balanced across different timeframes. Furthermore, in jurisdictions that have restructured their electricity industries, balancing practices that were previously administered by a vertically-integrated utility have been adapted into or integrated with market-based mechanisms.

In the subsections that follow, I describe balancing practices in the order of the timescales in which they are relevant (i.e. from milliseconds to years, as shown in @fig:power_system_timeframes).

### Frequency control services {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-fcs}

**Frequency control services** (leftmost section of the processes, services and markets shown in @fig:power_system_timeframes) are ancillary services used by the SO to contain AC frequency within as narrow a band as possible during normal operation and following **contingency events** (sudden disturbances) [@etoFrequencyControlRequirements2018]. With the exception of inertial response from synchronous machines ([@sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-inertial_response]), these services are provided by power system resources with 1) the appropriate control system configurations and 2) capacity flexibility in the form of **headroom** (the ability to increase active power output) for responding to an under-frequency event and/or **footroom** (the ability to decrease active power output) for responding to an over-frequency event [@etoUseFrequencyResponse2010]. Whereas vertically-integrated utilities must schedule resources to provide frequency control services, SOs in restructured electricity industries typically procure frequency control services through regulatory and market-based mechanisms (see @sec:fcs-context-procurement).

As shown in @fig:freq_control and discussed further in @sec:fcs, the conventional frequency control services described below differ based on their purpose, response time and activation and control methods.

![(a) A trace of power system frequency with corresponding frequency control services following a loss-of-generation contingency event. (b) The timescales over which the various frequency control services are provided. Source: @australianenergymarketoperatorPowerSystemRequirements2020](source/figures/freq_control_timeframes.png){#fig:freq_control short-caption="Sequence and timescales of typical frequency control services"}

#### Inertial response {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-inertial_response}

As discussed in @sec:lit_review-balancing_need-frequency, synchronous machines have an *inherent* inertial response to AC frequency deviations that must be considered in the frequency control strategy of a power system. For a given active power imbalance, the inertia constant of the synchronous area ($H$ in [@eq:swing_area]) determines the magnitude of the initial RoCoF following an imbalance event and the speed at which the power system can be returned to its nominal frequency [@ulbigImpactLowRotational2014; @tielensRelevanceInertiaPower2016].

#### Fast frequency response

IBRs and loads on frequency-responsive relays can provide what is typically known as fast frequency response (FFR). The most prominent use-case for FFR is the mitigation of high RoCoFs through a response delivered within a matter of milliseconds to a few seconds following a contingency event [@millerTechnologyCapabilitiesFast2017; @australianenergymarketoperatorFastFrequencyResponse2017]. As I also touch upon in [@sec:fcs-ibr-challenges], the term FFR has been used rather loosely to date to refer to three distinct control configurations:

1. An *inherent* response delivered by IBRs that, though they lack a spinning mass, resembles the inertial response of synchronous machines (sometimes referred to as virtual inertia) [@linResearchRoadmapGridForming2020];
2. A *controlled* response delivered by wind generation in which kinetic energy is extracted from a wind turbine rotor to rapidly inject active power into the system (sometimes referred to as synthetic inertia or inertia-based FFR) [@erikssonSyntheticInertiaFast2018; @nercinverter-basedresourceperformancetaskforceFastFrequencyResponse2020];
3. A *controlled and sustained* response delivered by IBRs and frequency-responsive loads that is more or less a faster version of primary frequency response ([@sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-pfr]) [@dreidyInertiaResponseFrequency2017; @fernandez-guillamonPowerSystemsHigh2019; @nercinverter-basedresourceperformancetaskforceFastFrequencyResponse2020].

#### Primary frequency response {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-pfr}

The aim of primary frequency response (PFR) is to arrest a frequency deviation. PFR is implemented in resource-level control systems such that each enabled resource provides a response to locally-measured frequency deviations that exceed a certain control dead-band [@wangReviewAGCImplementation2003; @elaAlternativeApproachesIncentivizing2012]. For generators, this is achieved through **droop control**, in which a synchronous speed deviation produces a change in the active power output of a generator according to its droop characteristic ([@fig:droop], e.g. from A to B along $L_0$). Droop control is implemented in the turbine governors of synchronous generators and the inverter control systems of IBRs [@fernandez-guillamonPowerSystemsHigh2019; @linResearchRoadmapGridForming2020]. Provided there is a sufficient amount of PFR reserve to arrest the system frequency, the frequency **zenith**/**nadir** (maximum/minimum system frequency following an active power imbalance event) is determined by the size of the initial imbalance, the inertia constant of the synchronous area, the droop characteristics of power system resources and the speed of PFR [@nercinverter-basedresourceperformancetaskforceFastFrequencyResponse2020]. PFR should ideally be sustained until secondary frequency control can take over (i.e. several to tens of seconds) [@etoUseFrequencyResponse2010; @etoFrequencyControlRequirements2018; @undrillPrimaryFrequencyResponse2018; @undrillNotesFrequencyControl2019].

#### Secondary frequency control

Secondary frequency response (SFR) is designed to take over from and "relieve" fast-acting PFR. SFR is implemented in resource-level load controllers, which can [@undrillNotesFrequencyControl2019; @etoFrequencyControlRequirements2018].:

1. Be pre-configured to respond following a frequency deviation through a frequency bias setting. This could include sustaining already-delivered PFR (as shown in @fig:droop); or
2. Receive control signals from Automatic Generation Control (AGC), a control system used by the SO to coordinate SFR across the control area. The AGC's control objective is to minimise Area Control Error subject to a tie-line bias and thus return power system frequency to its nominal value. Following the calculation of a required response that occurs in each cycle (these are typically several seconds apart), the AGC then communicates with each enabled resources to provide them with active power adjustment targets [@machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020]. The service provided by these enabled resources is referred to as **regulation** in many jurisdictions [@elaOperatingReservesVariable2011; @hewickerDimensioningControlReserves2020].

![The behaviour of a synchronous generator providing PFR and SFR in the absence of other resources with droop control. $L_0$ is the initial droop characteristic of the turbine governor. The generator is initially operating at point A with an active power output of $P_{M0}$ and synchronous speed $\omega_0$. Following an imbalance event, the system frequency begins to drop as the synchronous generator provides inertial response. The turbine governor then begins to actuate and moves the synchronous generator along the droop characteristic. A new steady-state is reached at point B, where the generator's active power output is $P_{M1}$ and the system frequency (and hence the synchronous speed of the turbine) has decreased to $\omega_1$.  This constitutes the provision of PFR. Following this, the generator load controller changes the reference speed setpoint of the governor and thus shifts the droop characteristic to $L_1$. This subsequent control action sustains PFR and returns the system to frequency $\omega_0$. This constitutes the provision of SFR. Source: @wangReviewAGCImplementation2003.](source/figures/droop.png){#fig:droop width="75%" short-caption="An example of secondary frequency response sustaining primary frequency response"}

#### Tertiary frequency control

In power systems where scheduling processes are infrequently run (e.g. vertically-integrated utilities that historically produced hourly schedules) or in which a "safety margin" is desired to address active power imbalances that endure over multiple scheduling intervals, tertiary frequency response (TFR) is deployed to relieve PFR and SFR [@hewickerDimensioningControlReserves2020]. Some jurisdictions, such as those operated by the California and Midcontinent ISOs, have introduced **ramping reserves**, which are essentially a form of TFR intended to address increased variability and uncertainty across dispatch intervals (i.e. several minutes to an hour) due to growing penetrations of VRE [@elaWholesaleElectricityMarket2016; @elaElectricityMarketsRenewables2017]. Others, such as the Australian NEM, rely on balancing flexibility obtained through frequent scheduling processes (though the introduction of an operating reserve service – a form of ramping TFR – had recently been proposed; see @sec:reserves-orcontext) [@australianenergymarketoperatorPowerSystemRequirements2020; @rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015].

### Scheduling {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-scheduling}

The purpose of **scheduling** is to produce efficient (or economic) generation and consumption schedules for the minutes to days ahead based on expected power system conditions (typically non-scheduled demand and VRE generation forecasts). Inspired by @chowElectricityMarketDesign2005, I divide the scheduling problem into three phases: dispatch, unit commitment and longer-term scheduling.

#### Dispatch

Dispatch involves the assignment of generation or consumption targets to already-committed (see [@sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-scheduling-uc]) power system resources in real-time (i.e. several minutes ahead of delivery). Dispatch is carried out by vertically-integrated utilities, the SO in central dispatch markets and self-managed by market participants in self-dispatch markets. In the first two cases, the power system is dispatched by a SO running a process known as **security-constrained economic dispatch**. Security-constrained economic dispatch typically seeks to find a minimum cost operating configuration for committed generation and loads such that a short-term forecast of non-scheduled demand can be met subject to network constraints and stability and reliability requirements[^4] [@graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994]. Some SOs solve this problem for a single interval (e.g. as in the Australian NEM), whereas others, including the California and Midcontinent ISOs, solve a multi-period dispatch to procure and, to some extent, price capabilities to address expected non-scheduled demand ramps [@schiroProcurementPricingRamping2017; @elaSchedulingPricingExpected2016]. The dispatch solution for each dispatch interval (typically 5–15 minutes long [@irenaIncreasingTimeGranularity2019]) consists of generation and consumption setpoints, enablement quantities for resources providing frequency control services and, in central dispatch markets that integrate power system and market operation, real-time market locational marginal prices for energy and ancillary services [@cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017]. If piecewise linear functions are used by vertically-integrated utilities to model resource cost curves, or are required by the real-time market bid format for a market participant's energy offer curve[^5], the security-constrained economic dispatch problem can be efficiently solved using linear programming techniques [@woodPowerGenerationOperation2014].

[^4]: This is a common variant of the generic problem description described in [@sec:lit_review-operations].

[^5]: Bid formats may actually require monotonically increasing price-quantity pairs, but these can be used to construct piecewise linear increasing offer curves.

#### Unit commitment {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-scheduling-uc}

Thermal and hydroelectric generation, which historically dominated supply in many power systems, have inflexibility constraints (minimum load, start-up time, ramping limits and minimum up and down times) and costs (those attached to resource start-up, shut-down and operation at minimum load) that require SOs and market participants to make non-trivial **unit commitment** decisions (i.e. whether a resource should be online or offline). Depending on the resource, these decisions are made anywhere from 5 minutes to several hours ahead of power delivery [@denholmHowLowCan2018; @agoraenergiewendeFlexibilityThermalPower2017]. Unit commitment is:

- Self-managed by market participants in self-dispatch markets and in single-platform semi-centralised markets such as the Australian NEM;
- Built into the day-ahead market and intra-day reliability processes in central dispatch markets; and
- Managed by vertically-integrated utilities for all resources in jurisdictions that have not undergone restructuring. 

In the latter two cases, the SO runs a process known as **security-constrained unit commitment**, which typically seeks to determine the minimum cost subset of power system resources that should be committed to meet a non-scheduled demand forecast for a future horizon (usually 36–48 hours ahead) subject to network constraints and stability and reliability requirements. Security-constrained unit commitment is usually formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. Solving integer programs is computationally complex due to the non-convexity of the integral solution space [@woodPowerGenerationOperation2014; @knuevenMixedintegerProgrammingFormulations2020].

In the day-ahead platforms of central dispatch markets, market participants submit start-up and no-load (minimum load) costs in addition to a piecewise linear offer for energy [@herreroEvolvingBiddingFormats2020]. The SO solves a security-constrained unit commitment problem to clear the day-ahead market and produce an ahead schedule, which is usually only financially binding (i.e. deviations from this schedule are settled using real-time prices), in addition to locational prices for energy and ancillary services for each market interval in the day-ahead horizon (usually each hour) [@isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009; @cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017]. As discussed in [@sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms-markets-platforms], the day-ahead market platform provides market participants with an opportunity to hedge their real-time market position, and gives both market participants and the SO a degree of certainty in schedules well before power delivery.

#### Longer-term scheduling

Operational planning actions taken in longer-term scheduling timeframes (i.e. a day ahead to a few years ahead) include resource maintenance scheduling, the management of energy/fuel reserves and ensuring that any social and environmental obligations placed on resources are met (e.g. regulated discharges from hydroelectric scheme dams). Many of these activities are conducted on the basis of information supplied by longer-term weather/climate, power system and market forecasts [@helistoIncludingOperationalAspects2019; @sucklingSeasonaltoDecadalClimateForecasting2018; @denholmHowLowCan2018]. Energy reserve management is a particularly important aspect of longer-term scheduling for power system resources that face material opportunity-costs due to limited energy/fuel storage capacity, seasonally-variable primary energy source availability and/or degradation from operation [@xuRoleModelingBattery2022; @mcphersonImpactsStorageDispatch2020]. In restructured electricity industries, longer-term scheduling requires market participants to also consider and potentially change their forward market position, which is shaped by the electricity derivatives and contracts they hold [@macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020].

## Designing balancing practices in operational timeframes {#sec:lit_review-design}

Energy transition has prompted policy-makers worldwide to revisit and redesign existing balancing practices in their jurisdictions (see [@sec:fcs-intro] and [@sec:reserves-intro]). While there is a degree of international consensus surrounding desirable high-level design outcomes ([@sec:lit_review-design_outcomes]) and the design areas that deserve the most attention [@papaefthymiou100RenewableEnergy2016; @holttinenDesignOperationEnergy2021; @rieszDesigningElectricityMarkets2015], various barriers and complexities pose challenges to the design and implementation of specific mechanisms and contribute to the contested nature of the design process [@papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018; @silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022; @schittekatteFlexibilityMarketsProject2020; @macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020]. I discuss the most pertinent of these in [@sec:lit_review-design_challenges].

### Outcomes of good design {#sec:lit_review-design_outcomes}

Below, I present three desirable outcomes of the design process that I use to assess changes to balancing practices throughout this thesis. All three have been previously discussed in the literature and in a co-authored submission to an Australian NEM reform process [@macgillResponseEnergySecurity2020]. As I discuss further in [@sec:fcs-design] and [@sec:reserves-intro], there are, in practice, trade-offs that mean that an improvement in one outcome may come at the expense of another.

1. **Effectiveness**. Effective balancing practices procure balancing flexibility that is sufficient, in terms of both quantity and performance, to ensure that power system balancing requirements are met. I extend effectiveness to also include the robustness of balancing practices to the wide range of future operating conditions and system configurations that may arise as energy transition proceeds [@australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021; @prakashResponseFrequencyControl2021].

2. **Efficiency**. Efficient balancing practices procure balancing flexibility at the lowest cost to the system, both now (**productive efficiency**) and into the future (**dynamic efficiency**). Furthermore, efficient arrangements should also procure the right mix of balancing flexibility according to balancing requirements determined by user and/or system needs (**allocative efficiency**).

3. **Minimising administrative costs and complexity**. Administrative costs, such as those associated with operating a market for procuring balancing flexibility or with verifying the delivery of balancing flexibility, can be significant. Administrative costs include expenses related to metering equipment, IT systems and additional staff. Complex administrative arrangements can be problematic as they may interact with other components and/or processes in the power system in ways that are unforeseen and unintended.

### Existing and emerging challenges in the design process {#sec:lit_review-design_challenges}

#### Variable renewable energy and inverter-based resources

Many jurisdictions are presently experiencing or are soon expected to experience high instantaneous penetrations of VRE resources and IBRs [@australianenergymarketoperatorMaintainingPowerSystem2019; @matevosyanFutureInverterBasedResources2021; @elaElectricityMarketFuture2021]. VRE resources pose challenges to power system balancing as they introduce additional variability and uncertainty, and because IBRs do not provide an inherent or controlled response to frequency deviations unless they are explicitly configured to do so. I elaborate on these challenges in [@sec:fcs-intro], [@sec:fcs-ibr-challenges] and [@sec:reserves-intro]. These challenges are of greater concern to islanded power systems and weakly-interconnected control areas that have limited to no assistance from a wider synchronous area for balancing assistance [@hodgeAddressingTechnicalChallenges2020].

#### The tension between effectiveness and efficiency

The tension between effectiveness, the primary objective of engineering standards and practices, and efficiency, an outcome championed by economists and often pursued through markets, significantly contributes to the complexity and contested nature of the design process in restructured electricity industries. One perspective of this tension (which I present in [@sec:fcs-intro] and [@sec:reserves-intro] and is extensively discussed by @chaoInterfaceEngineeringMarket2005) is that the efficiency gains obtained through market-based mechanisms for procuring balancing flexibility may come at the expense of the redundancy, certainty and control that a SO might require to guarantee effective balancing. An alternative perspective of this tension is that restructuring enables market participants to scrutinise and lobby for changes to operational practices that adhere to engineering best-practice regardless of the costs of doing so. In other words, market participants can help achieve efficient operation through advocacy "because choices of operating standards can severely impact their profits", especially in the case of practices associated with "costs that the [SO] passes to participants via grid management charges" [@chaoInterfaceEngineeringMarket2005, p.1984].

The tension between effectiveness and efficiency can be reframed as the problem of specifying the degree to which balancing flexibility procurement arrangements are *centralised*. Typically, the procurement of specialised and system-critical frequency control services is more closely managed by the SO whereas the provision of some forms of balancing flexibility in scheduling timeframes is largely left to market participants to manage. I draw on this problem framing when outlining the research objectives of this thesis in [Chapter @sec:research_framework].

#### The requirement for "second-best" design {#sec:lit_review-design-challenges-secondbest}

Perspectives from both engineering and economics have been invoked in the electricity market design literature when referring to the "second-best" design challenge. @macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020 approach the market design problem with a systems engineering perspective guided by the principle of sub-optimisation, which holds that:

> Optimizing each subsystem independently will not in general lead to a system optimum, or more strongly, improvement of a particular subsystem may actually worsen the overall system [@machol1965system]

@pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019 and @maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021 discuss a similar challenge, but instead invoke Lipsey's "General Theory of Second Best", which states that [@lipseyGeneralTheorySecond1956, p.11]:

> If there is introduced into a general equilibrium system a constraint which prevents the attainment of one of the Paretian conditions, the other Paretian conditions, although still attainable, are, in general, no longer desirable

In other words, if a constraint imposed by technical, social or political factors (some of these are referred to as "market distortions" in the literature) or by the construct of the market itself (discussed later in this subsection) prevents some conditions and/or features that are necessary for an efficient outcome, then 1) pursuing the other conditions and/or features required by that design does not guarantee an improvement in system welfare (it may, in some cases, even worsen it) and 2) imposing other "market distortions" (often regulatory mechanisms) on the system may actually improve welfare outcomes. For example, "the adoption of a free trade policy by one country, in a multi-country tariff ridden world, may actually lower the real income of that country and of the world" [@lipseyGeneralTheorySecond1956, p.14].

There are several facets of the design problem warrant a "second-best" approach to design solutions. Firstly, as raised in [@sec:fcs-intro] and demonstrated in [@nahmmacherStrategiesShocksPower2016], there is often an asymmetry between the high costs[^6] of power system collapse due to inadequate balancing flexibility, and the relatively lower costs of measures that the SO can take to mitigate system failure [@lalEssentialSystemServices2021]. This cost asymmetry suggests that there are externalities tied to security and reliability (security-of-supply) that are not reflected in the price of balancing processes, services and products [@macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020; @kepplerWhySustainableProvision2022]. As suggested by R. H. Coase's analysis of the problem of "social cost", there exists a bargaining solution for addressing security-of-supply externalities in the form of **differentiated reliability** (i.e. consumers of electricity pay for different levels of service) [@billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020; @maysPrivateRiskSocial2022]; however, the issue of equitable access to an essential service and the significant transaction costs[^7] associated with this solution have led to the characterisation of security-of-supply as a public good and the allocation of responsibility for reliability to the SO [@coaseProblemSocialCost1960]. The ultimate outcome here is that the effective provision of the public good (i.e. meeting a system-wide requirement for reliability) requires "distortions" in the markets for the products and services that are required to provide it [@maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021]. For example, many markets for frequency control services are monopsonistic; the SO is the sole buyer and controls market demand, albeit on behalf of the system to ensure that sufficient capabilities are procured for secure and reliable operation [@reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007]. I discuss the role of other "distortions" and market incompleteness in hindering efficient price formation and cost allocation in Australian frequency control markets in [@sec:fcs].

[^6]: I refer here to quantifiable economic costs, but there are of course significant social costs associated with the loss of electricity supply given that it is necessary for many end-uses including other essential services that are critical to the health and wellbeing of people [@australianenergymarketoperatorSubmissionAERWALDO2020; @australianenergymarketoperator2020ISPAppendix2020; @prakashResponseCapacityMechanism2022].

[^7]: At least historically, though technological advances are challenging this notion [@borensteinEconomicsElectricityReliability2023; @billimoriaInsuranceMechanismElectricity2022].

Secondly, because unbundled SOs have neither direct control nor ownership of generation or demand-side resources (see [@sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms]), policy-makers in restructured jurisdictions are constrained in the design problem because SOs must *procure* rather than provide balancing flexibility. In the absence of such a constraint, it might be more effective and/or efficient for the SO itself to provide balancing flexibility. Referring to ancillary services (of which frequency control services are a subset), @pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019 argue that in the absence of limits on SO ownership, Coase's insights on the nature of the firm suggest that transaction costs would determine whether the SO provides ancillary services themselves or outsources their provision via spot market procurement [@coaseNatureFirm1937]:

> [Ancillary services are often] associated with significant uncertainties about how much to procure and may be subject to significant market power within the limited local area that they are needed (especially for voltage support and constraint management). (...) Internal production works well in conditions of uncertainty about how much to procure and/or how the costs of different quality features trade off with each other. In-house production can also be a good way to manage external suppliers who would otherwise exercise market power.

This excerpt alludes to the "quality" constraint imposed by the construct of (spot) markets. As I discuss in [@sec:fcs-efficiency-challenges] and [@sec:reserves-intro], spot markets work best with well-defined, fungible and discrete products. However, such products ignore interdependencies and the wide technical capability "spectrum" of power system resources [@gimonGridPhysicsMarkets2020]. The question here is whether the potential benefits of spot market competition and transparency outweigh those of SO coordination and a more nuanced or layered approach. Coordination is particularly desirable for balancing flexibility services that are "lumpy" and/or inseparable from other services. For example, mechanical inertia provision requires the commitment of synchronous generation, which in turn augments rotor angle stability and system strength [@billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020].

In practice, long-term bilateral contracts constitute a "second-best" solution that enables SOs to procure balancing flexibility in the presence of uncertainty or market power, or where there is a requirement for a tailored service or a multi-faceted product [@pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019]. If there are benefits to be gained from competitive pressure, these sorts of contracts can be awarded to market participants through tender processes that assess multiple criteria [@reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007].

#### The design problem is underdetermined

The design problem for balancing practices is often **underdetermined**, i.e. it has many possible solutions. As I argue in [@sec:reserves-intro], this is because some processes, services and markets have overlapping roles and functions. One of the challenges that arises from a wide solution space is assessing the various trade-offs between different objectives [@vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016]. For example, it is challenging for policy-makers to simultaneously minimise complexity, reduce constraints on the system and account for the interdependency, interoperability and interchangeability of balancing practices.

#### Grid architectures

Power systems are becoming increasingly distributed as they integrate large numbers of consumer-owned energy resources. This shift has prompted policy-makers to propose new **grid architectures** that re-envisage the roles of and relationships between actors and resources in their jurisdictions [@conejoRethinkingRestructuredElectricity2018]. Examples include architectures that build power system resilience through interconnected microgrids [@hannaDesigningResilientDecentralized2022], or those that enable consumer-owned energy resources to actively participate in transmission or distribution-level real-time markets [@kristovTaleTwoVisions2016;@schittekatteDistributedEnergyResources2022]. Transitioning to any one grid architecture requires forward-looking balancing practice design; however, given long-term planning involves deep uncertainties [@lambertChallengeLongTermPolicy2003], policy-makers must maximise *design* flexibility (or alternatively, reduce the number of design and system constraints imposed by operational practices) to retain option value [@fisherInvestmentUncertaintyOption2000].

#### Diversity of initial conditions and outcomes

The design process has proceeded differently across jurisdictions due, in part, to technological, infrastructural, institutional and behavioural differences [@papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018;@ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022]. These differences are likely to persist as jurisdictions revisit their balancing practices due to the **path dependency** of energy systems (i.e. initial "lock-ins" have a large bearing on what system trajectories and futures are possible) [@fouquetPathDependenceEnergy2016]. Diversity of initial conditions and outcomes poses a challenge to the design problem because policy-makers in one jurisdiction must judge the experiences with a particular practice in another jurisdiction within that context. In other words, experiences from one jurisdiction do not transfer straightforwardly to another.

## Conclusion: the knowledge gap {#sec:lit_review-gap}

In light of increasing penetrations of VRE, policy-makers worldwide are contemplating redesigning operational balancing practices in their jurisdictions. The task of designing effective and efficient operational practices requires them to build an understanding of several facets of the design problem, including:

1. The technical capabilities and constraints of power system resources and system control strategies;
2. The socioeconomic objectives of the power system;
3. The institutional arrangements of a jurisdiction; and
4. The broader cultural and political factors that have influenced the organisation of the electricity industry.

Though developing this understanding is a significant undertaking in and of itself, the design problem is made even more complex by 1) the presence of existing tensions and challenges and 2) a changing resource mix. The former means that whilst "operating power systems primarily relying on [VRE] is technologically possible", the design process is "institutionally complex" [@papaefthymiou100RenewableEnergy2016, p.81]. The latter invites new perspectives on challenges and solutions — for example, proponents of stronger price formation in real-time markets now not only argue that it is essential for efficient operation of and investment in utility-scale resources, but also that it is necessary so that the market can serve as a means to coordinate distributed consumer-owned energy resources [@hoganMarketDesignPractices2019].

Whilst the literature has identified high-level design outcomes and the design areas that deserve the most attention, there is, as @maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021 indicates, a role for empirical work that identifies "second-best" and flexible design solutions given the specific context of each power system and jurisdiction. Such an approach recognises that effective, efficient and streamlined balancing practices arise not from "optimal" settings, but from solutions that combine and compromise. [Chapters @sec:fcs; Chapters @sec:reserves] and [-@sec:info] attempt to take such an approach when assessing how best to balance electricity markets with increasing penetrations of variable renewable energy in operational timeframes.
