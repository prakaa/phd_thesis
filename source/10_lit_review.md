# Literature review {#sec:lit_review}

## Introduction

<!--
Due to falling capital costs and growing concern around carbon-intensive electricity production and global warming, power systems around the world are undergoing an energy transition in which synchronous generators fuelled by fossil fuels are being displaced by variable renewable energy resources, such as solar photovoltaic systems and wind turbines [@DeConinck2018]. The inherent characteristics and control systems of variable renewable energy and other inverter-based resources differ from those of conventional synchronous generators. This poses both opportunities and challenges to the control of alternating current (AC) frequency in the power system. Failure to ensure that frequency is controlled within power system limits may result in equipment damage, load shedding and cascading failures that lead to blackouts.

## Outline of literature review

<!--
In this literature review, we lay a theoretical foundation for designing efficient and effective frequency control arrangements in electricity markets with growing levels of inverter-based resources. Frequency control arrangements include the specification, procurement and provision of frequency control services and products from power system resources. In [2](#sec:elec_markets){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:elec_markets"}, we review current electricity market structures and practices, with a focus on how mandatory pool markets attempt to balance supply and demand for electricity. In [3](#sec:fundamentals){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:fundamentals"}, we explore how the supply-demand balance is linked to AC frequency and how synchronous machines behave in response to frequency deviations. Then, in [4](#sec:freq_dev_control){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:freq_dev_control"}, we explore the need for frequency control and outline a typical power system frequency control scheme. In [5](#sec:ibr_freq){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:ibr_freq"} and [6](#sec:procurement){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:procurement"}, we explore the existing and emerging challenges and opportunities that are faced by control mechanisms and schemes, and frequency control services procurement mechanisms, respectively. Finally, in [7](#sec:designing_arrangements){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:designing_arrangements"}, we frame the frequency control arrangement design problem in mandatory pool markets and outline the outcomes we expect from good design.

## Power systems {#sec:lit_review-power_systems}

Given the welfare and economic benefits associated with electricity access, many 20^th^ century states constructed bulk *power systems* to leverage investment & operational economies of scale. These systems sought to efficiently deliver *active power* (i.e. power that does work) to numerous electricity end-users (*demand* or *loads*) from electricity suppliers (*generators*) across vast distances. A typical power system configuration is presented in [@fig:elec_supply_chain]. Generators supply the system with alternating current (AC) power either through a direct electromagnetic connection or, if they are *inverter-based resources* (IBRs)[^1], through a power electronic *inverter* interface that converts the direct current (DC) power produced by the generator to AC power. AC power is then efficiently transmitted over long distances through a high voltage *transmission* system. As transmission lines approach load centres, voltages are stepped down to make power delivery to the houses and businesses connected to the lower voltage *distribution system* safer [@mastersRenewableEfficientElectric2004].

Source: @australianenergymarketoperatorIndustryOverview2023.](source/figures/electricity_supply_chain.pdf){#fig:elec_supply_chain short-caption="The bulk power system as an electricity supply chain"}

[^1]: These include VRE IBRs (solar PV and Type III and Type IV wind turbines), battery energy storage systems and voltage sourcec converter high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines [@achillesIntegratingInverterBasedResources2017; @machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020].

### Synchronous and control areas

A network area that is operated at a (constant) nominal AC frequency is known as a *synchronous area*. During normal operation, AC frequency should be close to the system's nominal value and more-or-less uniform across the synchronous area (see @sec:lit_review-balancing_need). A *control area*, on the other hand, is a network area which a particular *system operator* (SO) is responsible for operating. In this thesis, I use the term *jurisdiction* interchangeably with *control area*, with a preference for the former when referring to a control area with a wholesale electricity market (see [@sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms]).

Whether the term "power system" refers to a synchronous area or a control area is often dependent on context and the relationship between the two in the jurisdiction in question. In eastern and southern Australia, the National Electricity Market's (NEM) single control area consists of two synchronous areas (see [@sec:fcs-nem] for further detail). In contrast, other jurisdictions have a single synchronous area composed of several electrically-connected control areas demarcated by political, rather than physical boundaries. For example, continental Europe is a single synchronous area consisting of many national or trans-national control areas, and the continental United States has three synchronous areas (two of which extend into Canada) with over 60 control areas [@schittekatteDistributedEnergyResources2022; @northamericanelectricreliabilitycorporationNERCInterconnections2023].

## Power system operations {#sec:lit_review-operations}

In broad terms, *operating* a power system involves the direction or control of *power system resources* — generators, loads, network elements and energy storage resources (which can act as both a generator and a load). In practice, however, power system operation is inseparable from the economic objective imposed upon SOs: minimise system costs (or under some market paradigms, maximise the value of trade) whilst 1) continuously maintaining a balance between active power supply & demand and 2) ensuring that system resources & the system itself are operated within their respective technical envelopes [@woodPowerGenerationOperation2014]. The latter constraint implies *secure* (or *stable*) operation and is a prerequisite for the former constraint, which more-or-less corresponds to *reliable* operation[^2] [@anderssonPowerSystemSecurity2021]. Maintaining a secure and reliable power system is vital; restarting the system after failure (*system restoration*) is a long & complex procedure, and power outages (*blackouts*), whether they be localised or across a wider area, can have devastating social & economic consequences [@kirschenFundamentalsPowerSystem2004].

[^2]: Strictly speaking, reliability is typically defined as the ability of generation to supply load requirements to an administratively-set standard that varies across jurisdictions.

Noting that planning & investment have a large bearing on the manner in which a power system is operated (and vice versa), [@fig:power_system_timeframes] presents a high-level overview of power system phenomena and processes, services & markets that are most pertinent to active power balancing in operational timeframes, with those discussed in detail within this thesis highlighted in bold red text.

### Phenomena in operational timeframes

As shown in @fig:power_system_timeframes, power system operations is concerned with phenomena that dominate on timescales ranging from a few milliseconds to several months [@hatziargyriouDefinitionClassificationPower2021; @machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020]:

1.  *Electromagnetic* phenomena arise from the coupling of electrical and magnetic fields within *synchronous machines* (generators and motors that rotate at a speed proportional to AC frequency) and between power system resources. They occur on the timescale of milliseconds to seconds. IBR controls also operate in this timeframe.

2.  *Electromechanical* phenomena are slower (seconds to minutes timescale) and arise as a result of electromagnetic fields interacting with rotating masses and mechanical forces. These typically occur in motors and generators.

3.  *Thermodynamic* phenomena are slower still. They encompass chemical fuel conversion & heat transfer processes in boilers. These phenomena occur over multiple timeframes, from seconds to minutes to hours. The dynamics of the primary energy sources for hydroelectricity and VRE are also relevant in these timeframes [@keeratimahatAnalysisShorttermOperational2021].

### Active power balancing {#sec:lit_review-balancing}

In theory, *active power balancing* is simply a consequence of the law of conservation of energy: the energy supplied through primary energy conversion or by energy storage into a network node is equal to the sum of the energy dissipated, stored and consumed at the same network node at each and every moment. In practice, however, it involves the **_moment-to-moment control_ of generation and loads to balance active power supply and demand _across the power system_**. *Moment-to-moment* (i.e. real-time) control of supply & demand is required because it is still uneconomical in many jurisdictions to store electricity at scale despite grid-scale storage cost reductions [@internationalenergyagencyGridScaleStorage2022]. In other words, many power systems have small balancing buffers. Furthermore, though electricity can be transported close to the speed of light across the network, balancing requires at least a degree of coordination *across the power system* because of transmission losses and various network constraints imposed by line thermal limits, stability requirements & Kirchoff's circuit laws [@kirschenFundamentalsPowerSystem2004; @hirthWhyWindNot2016a].

#### Why is balancing required? {#sec:lit_review-balancing_need}

Unlike the transportation networks of many other commodities, an imbalance between active power supply & demand can lead to deviations in technical parameters — voltage and AC frequency — that not only have the potential to damage equipment connected to the power system, but also to trigger a system collapse [@borensteinEconomicsElectricityReliability2023]. As such, maintaining active power balance is essential to proper resource and system functioning.

##### The relationship between active power balance & AC frequency {#sec:lit_review-balancing_need-frequency}

The presence of synchronous machines in most power systems means that system active power balance is closely tied to the system's AC frequency. During steady state operation, synchronous machines rotate at a *synchronous speed* ($N_s$) that is proportional to the nominal system frequency ($f$) ([@eq:synch_speed]) [@chapmanElectricMachineryFundamentals2011]:

$$N_s = \frac{120f}{P}$$ {#eq:synch_speed}

where $N_s$ is the synchronous speed in revolutions per minute, $P$ is the number of (rotor) magnetic poles and $f$ is the electrical frequency in hertz.

The link between active power balance and synchronous speed/system frequency can be elucidated by examining synchronous machine dynamics. In a synchronous generator (coal-fired, gas-fired and hydro generators), the interaction between the interacting magnetic fields of the rotor and stator produces an electromagnetic torque ($T_e$) on the rotor that opposes the mechanical torque ($T_m$) supplied by a prime mover (e.g. steam turbine) ([@fig:synch_torques]). [@eq:swing], which is an energy balance variation of what is known as the *swing equation*, shows that if there is a transient increase in the electrical load of the power system (equivalent to an increase in $P_e$ and thus $T_e$), the rotor of a synchronous generator will begin to decelerate as its stored kinetic energy is converted to electrical energy [@graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994; @elgerdElectricEnergySystems1971].

$$J\omega_{sm}\frac{d\omega_{sm}}{dt} = P_m - P_e$$ {#eq:swing}

where $\omega_{sm}$ is the synchronous machine rotor shaft velocity, $J$ is moment of inertia of the rotor, $P_m$ is mechanical power, $T_m$ is mechanical torque, $P_e$ is electrical power and $T_e$ is electromagnetic torque.

![Mechanical power applied to the prime mover results in a mechanical torque $T_m$ on the rotor of a synchronous generator. This is opposed by an electromagnetic torque $T_e$ that is produced from the interaction of the rotor and stator magnetic fields. Source: @reboursComprehensiveAssessmentMarkets2009](source/figures/swing.png){#fig:synch_torques short-caption="Mechanical and electromagnetic torques on a synchronous generator" width="60%"}

The relationship between the active power imbalance in a power system ($P_{gen}-P_{load}$) and AC frequency is obtained by extending the dynamics of the swing equation from a single synchronous generator to all synchronous generators in a synchronous area ([@eq:swing_area]). [@eq:swing_area] shows that the rate of change of frequency (*RoCoF*) is proportional to the active power imbalance and inversely proportional to the system's inertia constant, $H$. This form of the swing equation only models the *inertial response* of synchronous generators; that is, it does not include the *load damping* response offered by (frequency-dependent) induction motor loads. Generation inertial response typically plays a large role in electromechanical system dynamics as the high speed and mass of generator rotors mean that they store significant quantities of kinetic energy [@ulbigImpactLowRotational2014; @denholmInertiaPowerGrid2020].

$$\frac{2H}{f}\frac{df}{dt} = \frac{P_{gen}-P_{load}}{S_{g, total}}$$ {#eq:swing_area}

where $H$ is the inertia constant of the synchronous area ($H=\sum_{g} H_g$, where $H_g = \frac{J_g(2\pi f)^2}{2S_g}$), $f$ is the AC frequency, $\frac{df}{dt}$ is the rate of change of frequency or RoCoF, $S_{g,total}$ is the total apparent power of synchronous generators, and $P_{gen}$ and $P_{load}$ are the system's total power supply and total power demand (including losses), respectively.

[@eq:swing_area] shows that a power system's AC frequency is an indicator of active power balance [@bagginiHandbookPowerQuality2008]. Insufficient generation will lead to a *decrease* in system frequency (i.e. negative RoCoF) and oversupply will lead to an *increase* in system frequency (i.e. positive RoCoF).

##### The consequences of frequency deviations {#sec:lit_review-balancing_need-consequences}

Serious power system frequency deviations away from the nominal value can have harmful effects. Synchronous machines may experience equipment-damaging vibrations [@ulbigImpactLowRotational2014], and both synchronous machines and transformers can overheat and fail if they operate outside their rated voltage-frequency limits [@kirbyFrequencyControlConcerns2002]. Synchronous machines are also vulnerable to damage from high RoCoFs due to pole slipping [@dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016]. For these reasons, frequency-sensitive relays are often used to protect power system resources from frequency excursions.

However, these same equipment protection measures can also trigger the complete collapse of the power system. Should the disconnection of a resource following a relay trip exacerbate an existing active power imbalance, the system frequency may deviate further and result in further disconnections. Situations such as these are known as *cascading failures* and can lead to the collapse of the entire power system. As such, SOs often employ emergency frequency control schemes to arrest imbalances by tripping loads in the event of under-frequency (*under-frequency load shedding* or *UFLS*) or generation in the event of over-frequency (*over-frequency generation shedding* or *OFGS*) [@australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021; @hartmannEffectsDecreasingSynchronous2019]. The activation of these schemes is undesirable; UFLS adversely affects power system reliability and both are intended to be a last line of defence against frequency-driven system collapse.

#### Threats to active power balance {#sec:lit_review-balancing_threats}

Threats to active power balance can be broadly categorised as either power system *variability* or power system *uncertainty*.

##### Power system variability

Power system variability refers to **expected** or forecasted changes to active power supply and/or demand. Sources of variability include fluctuations in load, oscillatory active power output from synchronous generators and VRE generation *ramping* (i.e. a sustained increase or decrease in active power output), which includes changes in solar PV generation during sunrise & sunset and in wind generation with wind speed variations [@elaOperatingReservesVariable2011; @australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020; @bloomItIndisputableFive2017].

##### Power system uncertainty

Power system uncertainty refers to **unexpected** changes to active power supply and/or demand. These include demand and VRE generation forecast errors (so-called "known unknowns"), and singular or widespread outage events ("unknown unknowns") triggered by the weather or unexpected system responses & interactions [@australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020; @elaOperatingReservesVariable2011; @egglestonSecurityResilienceTechnical2021].

### Operational paradigms {#sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms}

Given the need for at least some degree of balancing coordination in a power system (@sec:lit_review-balancing), SOs, which are a feature of all control area jurisdictions, have ultimate responsibility in ensuring that the area is operated in a secure and reliable manner [@roquesMarketDesignGeneration2008]. However, though the powers, responsibilities and degree of ring-fencing imposed upon the SO vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, these characteristics are first & foremost governed by the control area's *operational paradigm* [@chawlaGlobalTrendsElectricity2013]. Below, I discuss the two types of operational paradigms: where the SO is a *vertically-integrated utility*, and where the SO is, at the very least, responsible for operating a transmission system that forms the physical basis of a *wholesale electricity market*.

#### Vertically-integrated utility

Under this paradigm, a single company (either state-owned or privately-owned but regulated) owns, operates & invests in generation, transmission & distribution infrastructure, as well as being responsible for the retail of electricity to the end-user. This was the sole operational paradigm prior to the 1980s. Having a single owner and operator of power system resources reduces complexity, reduces transaction costs and enables economies of scale in both asset investment (particularly generation infrastructure) and operation  [@sioshansiElectricityMarketReform2006]. These latter benefit is material in the context of industrialisation and electrification driving sustained load growth, which occurred in advanced economies in the 20^th^ century and which many emerging economies continue to experience [@roquesAdaptingElectricityMarkets2017; @hoganElectricityMarketStructure2008].

#### Wholesale electricity markets

Beginning in the late 1980s, some jurisdictions opted to *restructure* their electricity sector. To varying degrees across different jurisdictions, the impetus for restructuring was the result of advancements in small low-upfront cost gas turbine technologies, the promise of consumer choice, perceptions that vertically-integrated utilities were inefficient & politicised, and a political zeitgeist prevalent at the time that pursued economic efficiency through privatisation & competition [@sioshansiElectricityMarketReform2006; @macgillElectricityIndustryReform2013; @simshauserLessonsAustraliaNational2019; @chesterEnergyProblemRepresentation2019]. Two features common to electricity industry restructuring processes were the *unbundling* of vertically-integrated utilities and the introduction of competition for wholesale supply (and in some cases, demand) via an *electricity market*.

##### Unbundling

In most cases, the unbundling of a vertically-integrated utility divided generation ownership and made the SO  responsible for the secure & reliable operation of the transmission network whilst often barring them from owning generation assets. In some jurisdictions, SOs were also given ownership of the transmission network (e.g. Transmission System Operators, or *TSOs*, in many European control areas) whereas others made their SOs "independent" by preventing them from any assets whatsoever (e.g. Independent System Operators in North American control areas). Some SOs, such as those in North America and the Australian NEM, were also given market operation responsibilities [@chawlaGlobalTrendsElectricity2013].

##### Market models

Much like unbundling, the design and implementation of wholesale electricity markets (an auction-based mechanism for the sale and/or purchase of electricity) differs across jurisdictions that engaged in restructuring. Despite these differences, electricity markets worldwide can broadly be categorised into two markets models[^3] that are distinguished by the degree of centralisation of system & market operations [@barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005; @cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017; @ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022]:

[^3]: I note that my descriptions of central and self-dispatch electricity markets differ slightly to those of @ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022, who focus on the level of centralisation in day-ahead timeframes. They categorise the Australian NEM as a decentralised market as participants manage self-commitment; however, the SO still produces resource-specific production & consumption targets through a central dispatch process that constitutes the real-time market. Refer to TODO: (Ref to information context) for more detail.

1.  *Central dispatch* markets, where decisions regarding *dispatch* and, in some cases, *unit commitment* (see [@sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-scheduling]) are made by the SO. System & market operations are often *integrated* (i.e. the SO is also the market operator) in central dispatch markets through the creation of a *mandatory power pool*, in which supply offers are aggregated and cleared against a demand forecast (one-sided pool) or against an aggregated demand curve constructed from potential buyers (two-sided pool) [@barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005]. In these markets, locational marginal prices for energy and *ancillary services* (services procured for to maintain security and reliability) are produced by centralised optimisation processes run by the SO that consider the physical constraints of the transmission system. As outlined in @sec:fcs-NA, this market model has been adopted in Independent System Operator/Regional Transmission Operator (ISO/RTO) markets in North America and, as I discuss in TODO: (Ref to information context), the Australian NEM has many features of a central dispatch market.

2.  Decentralised or *self-dispatch* markets, where decisions regarding dispatch and unit commitment are made by market participants and in which system & market operations are more decoupled. These types of markets facilitate trade through *bilateral contracts* between suppliers and buyers. Whilst scheduling and dispatch is managed by market participants, intended schedules are submitted by market participants ahead of time to the SO. The SO is responsible for taking *redispatch* actions to ensure that transmission constraints are not violated, and for determining the requirement for and procuring *balancing services* (another name for frequency control services, which I discuss in greater detail in [@sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-fcs]) that maintain system balance following market gate closure. As outlined in @sec:fcs-EU, this is the dominant market model in Europe.

@fig:market_models shows the primary and secondary commercial arrangements in each of these market models. Bilateral contracts (in the form of derivatives) are often used as hedging instruments in central dispatch markets, and several self-dispatch markets, such as those in Europe, have associated voluntary power exchanges that are essentially power pools [@barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005].

![Commercial arrangements in central and self-dispatch electricity markets. Reproduced from @barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005. TODO: Fix up figure.](source/figures/market_models.png){#fig:market_models}

##### Market platforms {#sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms-markets-platforms}

Power system resource inflexibilities and the desire for physical & financial risk management mechanisms in operational timeframes have led market designers in many jurisdictions to implement electricity markets with multiple market *platforms* [@energysecurityboardSystemServicesAhead2020; @isemongerBenefitsRisksVirtual2006]. Platforms are formal sub-markets for energy (and sometimes ancillary services) that are predominantly cleared **ahead* of the delivery of electricity and/or ancillary services. The number of platforms implemented in a particular market is often related to its market model. Self-dispatch markets can maximise trade and better enable market participants to balance their positions by implementing multiple market platforms (typically *day-ahead* and several *intra-day*) (see [@sec:fcs-EU]), whereas the number of platforms in central dispatch markets (typically *real-time* and in most cases, *day-ahead*) is limited by the computational complexity of the optimisation algorithm(s) used by the SO to clear the market (see [@sec:fcs-NA] and [@sec:fcs-NEM]) [@ahlqvistCentralSelfDispatchElectricity2018].

## Balancing practices in operational timeframes {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices}

SOs employ *balancing practices* in operational timeframes (which include the processes, services & markets shown in @fig:power_system_timeframes) to obtain *balancing flexibility*.  Balancing flexibility is procured either to directly address variability, or as optionality to mange uncertainty [@heggartyQuantifyingPowerSystem2020; @heggartyQuantifyingPowerSystem2020; @papaefthymiou100RenewableEnergy2016]. Though the particularities of these practices vary between jurisdictions, they are almost always organised in a hierarchical and sequential fashion to ensure that active power supply & demand are continuously balanced across different timeframes (see @sec:lit_review-balancing). Furthermore, in jurisdictions that have restructured their electricity industries, balancing practices that were previously administered by a vertically-integrated utility have been adapted into or integrated with market-based mechanisms.

### Typical balancing practices
    
In the subsections that follow, I describe balancing practices in the order of their timeframe of relevance (i.e. from milliseconds to years, as shown in @fig:power_system_timeframes).

#### Frequency control services {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-fcs}

*Frequency control services* (leftmost section of the processes, services & markets shown in @fig:power_system_timeframes) are ancillary services used by the SO to contain AC frequency within as narrow a band as possible during normal operation and following *contingency events* (sudden disturbances) [@etoFrequencyControlRequirements2018]. With the exception of inertial response from synchronous machines ([@sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-inertial_response]), these services are provided by power system resources with 1) the appropriate control system configurations and 2) capacity flexibility in the form of *headroom* (the ability to increase active power output) to respond to an under-frequency event and/or *footroom* (the ability to decrease active power output) to respond to an over-frequency event [@etoUseFrequencyResponse2010]. Whereas vertically-integrated utilities must schedule resources to provide frequency control services, SOs in restructured electricity industries typically procure frequency control services through regulatory and market-based mechanisms (see @sec:fcs-context-procurement).

As shown in @fig:freq_control and discussed further in @sec:fcs, the conventional frequency control services described below differ based on their purpose, response time and activation & control methods.

![(a) A trace of power system frequency with corresponding frequency control services following a loss-of-generation contingency event. (b) The timeframes over which the various frequency control services are provided. Source: @australianenergymarketoperatorPowerSystemRequirements2020](source/figures/freq_control_timeframes.png){#fig:freq_control}

##### Inertial response {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-inertial_response}

As discussed in @sec:lit_review-balancing_need-frequency, synchronous machines have an *inherent* inertial response to AC frequency deviations that must be considered in the frequency control strategy of a power system. For a given active power imbalance, the inertia constant of the synchronous area, $H$, determines the magnitude of the initial RoCoF following an imbalance event (see @eq:swing_area) and the speed at which the power system can be returned to the nominal frequency [@ulbigImpactLowRotational2014; @tielensRelevanceInertiaPower2016].

###### Fast frequency response

IBRs and loads on frequency-responsive relays can provide what is typically known as *fast frequency response* (FFR). The most widely discussed use-case for FFR is the mitigation of high RoCoFs (i.e. response delivery within a matter of milliseconds to a few seconds) following contingency events [@millerTechnologyCapabilitiesFast2017; @australianenergymarketoperatorFastFrequencyResponse2017]. In the electricity industry to date, the term FFR has been used rather loosely to refer to three distinct control configurations (I also discuss this in @sec-ibr-challenges):

1. An **inherent** response delivered by IBRs that, though they lack a spinning mass, resembles the inertial response of synchronous machines (sometimes referred to as *virtual inertia*) [@linResearchRoadmapGridForming2020];
2. A **controlled** response delivered by wind generation in which kinetic energy is extracted from a wind turbine rotor to rapidly inject active power (sometimes referred to as *synthetic inertia* or *inertia-based FFR*) [@erikssonSyntheticInertiaFast2018; @nercinverter-basedresourceperformancetaskforceFastFrequencyResponse2020];
3. A **controlled and sustained** response delivered by IBRs & frequency-responsive loads that is more-or-less a faster version of primary frequency response ([@sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-pfr]) [@dreidyInertiaResponseFrequency2017; @fernandez-guillamonPowerSystemsHigh2019; @nercinverter-basedresourceperformancetaskforceFastFrequencyResponse2020].

##### Primary frequency response {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-pfr}

The aim of primary frequency response (PFR) is to arrest a frequency deviation. PFR is implemented in  resource-level control systems such that each enabled resource provides a response to locally-measured frequency deviations that exceed a certain control dead-band [@wangReviewAGCImplementation2003; @elaAlternativeApproachesIncentivizing2012]. For generators, this is achieved through *droop control*, in which a deviation from synchronous speed corresponds to a change in the active power output of a generator according to its droop characteristic ([@fig:droop], from A to B along $L_0$). Droop control is implemented in the turbine governors of synchronous generators and the inverter control systems of IBRs [@fernandez-guillamonPowerSystemsHigh2019; @linResearchRoadmapGridForming2020]. Provided there is a sufficient amount of PFR reserve to arrest the system frequency, the frequency *zenith*/*nadir* (maximum/minimum system frequency following an active power imbalance event) is determined by the size of the imbalance event, the inertia constant of the synchronous area, the droop characteristics of power system resources and the speed of PFR [@nercinverter-basedresourceperformancetaskforceFastFrequencyResponse2020]. PFR should ideally be sustained until secondary frequency control can take over (i.e. several to tens of seconds) [@etoUseFrequencyResponse2010; @etoFrequencyControlRequirements2018; @undrillPrimaryFrequencyResponse2018; @undrillNotesFrequencyControl2019].

#### Secondary frequency control

Secondary frequency response (SFR) is designed to take over from and "relieve" fast-acting PFR. SFR is implemented in resource-level load controllers, which can [@undrillNotesFrequencyControl2019; @etoFrequencyControlRequirements2018].:

1. Be pre-configured to respond (including sustaining already-delivered PFR) following a frequency deviation through a *frequency bias* setting (as shown in @fig:droop); or
2. Receive control signals from *Automatic Generation Control* (AGC), a control system used by the SO to coordinate SFR across the control area. The AGC aims to minimise Area Control Error (ACE) subject to a tie-line bias, and thus return the power system to its nominal frequency, by communicating with enabled resources to make them adjust their active power output [@machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020]. The service provided by these enabled resources is referred to as *regulation* in many jurisdictions [@elaOperatingReservesVariable2011; @hewickerDimensioningControlReserves2020].

![Behaviour of a synchronous generator providing PFR and SFR in an isolated system. $L_0$ is the initial droop characteristic of the turbine governor. The generator is initially operating at point A with an active power output of $P_{M0}$. Following an imbalance event, system frequency (and hence the synchronous speed of the turbine) decreases from $\omega_0$ to $\omega_1$. The turbine governor then responds by moving the turbine along the droop characteristic to point B, thus increasing the generator's active power output to $P_{M1}$. This constitutes the provision of PFR. Following this, the generator load controller changes the reference speed setpoint of the governor and thus shifts the droop characteristic to $L_1$. This subsequent control action sustains PFR and returns the system to frequency $\omega_0$. This constitutes the provision of SFR. Source: @wangReviewAGCImplementation2003.](source/figures/droop.png){#fig:droop width="75%"}

#### Tertiary frequency control

In power systems where scheduling processes are infrequently run (e.g. vertically-integrated utilities that historically produced hourly schedules) or in which a "safety margin" is desired to address active power imbalances that endure over multiple scheduling intervals, tertiary frequency response (TFR) is deployed to relieve PFR & SFR [@hewickerDimensioningControlReserves2020]. Some jurisdictions, such as those operated by the California and Midcontinent ISOs, have introduced *ramping reserves*, which are essentially a form of TFR intended to address increased variability and uncertainty across dispatch intervals (i.e. several minutes to an hour) due to growing penetrations of VRE [@elaWholesaleElectricityMarket2016; @elaElectricityMarketsRenewables2017]. Others, such as the Australian NEM, rely on balancing flexibility obtained through frequent scheduling processes (though the implementation of an *operating reserve* service — a form of ramping TFR —  had been proposed; see @sec:reserves-orcontext) [@australianenergymarketoperatorPowerSystemRequirements2020; @rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015].

#### Scheduling {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-scheduling}

The purpose of *scheduling* is to produce efficient (or *economic*) generation and consumption schedules minutes to days ahead of delivery based on expected power system conditions (typically non-scheduled demand and VRE generation forecasts). Inspired by @chowElectricityMarketDesign2005, I divide the scheduling problem into three phases: *dispatch*, *unit commitment* and *longer-term scheduling*.

##### Dispatch

Dispatch involves the assignment of generation or consumption targets to already-committed (see [@sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-scheduling-uc]) power system resources in *real-time* (i.e. several minutes ahead of delivery). Dispatch is carried out by vertically-integrated utilities, the SO in central dispatch markets and self-managed by market participants in self-dispatch markets (see [@sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms]). In the first two cases, the power system is dispatched by a central operator which runs a process known as *security-constrained economic dispatch*. Security-constrained economic dispatch typically seeks to find a minimum cost operating configuration for committed generation and loads such that a short-term forecast of non-scheduled demand can be met subject to network constraints and stability & reliability requirements[^4] [@graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994]. Some SOs solve this problem for a single interval (e.g. as in the Australian NEM), whereas others, including the California and Midcontinent ISOs, solve a multi-period dispatch to procure and, to some extent, price capabilities to address expected non-scheduled demand ramps [@schiroProcurementPricingRamping2017; @elaSchedulingPricingExpected2016]. The dispatch solution for each dispatch interval (5-15 minutes long in many central dispatch markets [@irenaIncreasingTimeGranularity2019]) consists of generation & consumption setpoints, enablement quantities for resources providing frequency control services and, in central dispatch markets that integrate power system & market operation, real-time market locational marginal prices for energy & ancillary services [@cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017]. If piecewise linear functions are used by vertically-integrated utilities to model resource cost curves, or are required by the real-time market bid format for a market participant's energy offer curve[^5], the security-constrained economic dispatch problem can be efficiently solved using linear programming techniques [@woodPowerGenerationOperation2014].

[^4]: This is a common variant of the generic problem description discussed in [@sec:lit_review-operations].

[^5]: Bid formats may actually require monotonically increasing price-quantity pairs, but these can be used to construct piecewise linear increasing offer curves.

##### Unit commitment {#sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-scheduling-uc}

Thermal & hydroelectric generation, which historically dominated supply in many power systems, have inflexibility constraints (minimum load, start-up time, ramping limits and minimum up & down times) & costs (those attached to resource start-up, shut-down and operation at minimum load) that require SOs and market participants to make non-trivial *unit commitment* decisions (i.e. whether a resource should be online or offline). Depending on the resource, these decisions are made anywhere from 5 minutes to several hours ahead of power delivery [@denholmHowLowCan2018; @agoraenergiewendeFlexibilityThermalPower2017]. Unit commitment is:

- Self-managed by market participants in self-dispatch markets & in single-platform semi-centralised markets such as the Australian NEM;
- Built into the day-ahead market & intra-day reliability processes in central dispatch markets; and 
- Managed by vertically-integrated utilities for all resources in jurisdictions that have not undergone restructuring. 

In the latter two cases, the SO runs a process known as *security-constrained unit commitment*, which typically seeks to determine the minimum cost subset of power system resources that should be committed to meet a non-scheduled demand forecast for a future horizon (usually 36-48 hours ahead) subject to network constraints and stability & reliability requirements. Security-constrained unit commitment is usually formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. Solving integer programs is computationally complex due to the non-convexity of the integral solution space [@woodPowerGenerationOperation2014; @knuevenMixedintegerProgrammingFormulations2020].

In the day-ahead platforms of central dispatch markets, market participants submit start-up and no-load (minimum load) costs in addition to a piecewise linear offer for energy [@herreroEvolvingBiddingFormats2020]. The SO solves a security-constrained unit commitment problem to clear the day-ahead market and produce an ahead schedule, which is usually only financially binding (i.e. deviations from this schedule are settled using real-time prices), in addition to locational prices for energy and ancillary services for each market interval in the day-ahead horizon (usually each hour) [@isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009; @cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017]. As discussed in [@sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms-markets-platforms], the day-ahead market platform provides market participants with an opportunity to hedge their real-time market position, and gives both market participants & the SO a degree of certainty in schedules well before power delivery.

##### Longer-term scheduling

Operational planning actions taken in longer-term scheduling timeframes (a day ahead to a few years ahead) include resource maintenance scheduling, the management of *energy/fuel reserves* and ensuring that social & environmental obligations on resources are met (e.g. regulated discharges from hydroelectric scheme dams) [@helistoIncludingOperationalAspects2019; @sucklingSeasonaltoDecadalClimateForecasting2018; @denholmHowLowCan2018]. Many of these activities are conducted on the basis of information supplied by longer-term weather/climate, power system and market forecasts. Energy reserve management is a particularly important aspect of longer-term scheduling for power system resources that face material opportunity-costs due to limited energy/fuel storage capacity, seasonally-variable primary energy source availability and/or degradation from operation [@xuRoleModelingBattery2022; @mcphersonImpactsStorageDispatch2020]. In restructured electricity industries, longer-term scheduling requires market participants to also consider and potentially change their forward market position, which is defined by the *electricity derivatives & contracts* they hold [@macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020].

## Designing balancing practices in operational timeframes {#sec:lit_review-design}

Energy transition has prompted policy-makers worldwide to revisit & redesign existing balancing practices in their jurisdictions (see [@sec:fcs-intro] and [@sec:reserves-intro]). Though there is a degree of international consensus surrounding desirable high-level design outcomes ([@sec:lit_review-design-outcomes]) and the areas that deserve the most attention in the design process [@papaefthymiou100RenewableEnergy2016; @holttinenDesignOperationEnergy2021; @rieszDesigningElectricityMarkets2015], various barriers and complexities (I discuss the most pertinent of these in [@sec:lit_review-design-challenges]) pose challenges to the design & implementation of specific mechanisms and, more broadly, mean that the design process is contested [@papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018; @silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022; @schittekatteFlexibilityMarketsProject2020; @macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020]. In other words, "operating power systems primarily relying on [VRE] is technologically possible, but institutionally complex" [@papaefthymiou100RenewableEnergy2016, p.81].

### Outcomes of good design {#sec:lit_review-design-outcomes}

Below, I present three desirable outcomes of the design process that I use to assess changes to balancing practices throughout this thesis. All three have been previously discussed in the literature and in a co-authored submission to an Australian NEM reform process [@macgillResponseEnergySecurity2020]. As I discuss further in [@sec:fcs-design] and [@sec:reserves-intro], there are, in practice, trade-offs that mean that an improvement in one outcome may come at the expense of another. 

1. **Effectiveness**. Effective balancing practices procure sufficient balancing flexibility, in terms of both quantity and performance, to ensure that  power system balancing requirements are met. I extend effectiveness to also include the *robustness* of balancing practices to the wide range of future operating conditions and system configurations that may arise as energy transition proceeds [@australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021; @prakashResponseFrequencyControl2021].

2. . **Efficiency**. Efficient balancing practices procure balancing flexibility at the lowest cost to the system, both now (productive efficiency) and into the future (dynamic efficiency). Furthermore, efficient arrangements should also procure the right mix of balancing flexibility (i.e. across space and time) according to balancing requirements determined by user and/or system needs (*allocative efficiency*).

3. **Minimising administrative costs and complexity**. Administrative costs, e.g. those associated with operating a market for procuring balancing flexibility or with verifying the delivery of balancing flexibility, can be significant. Administrative costs include expenses related to metering equipment, IT systems and additional staff. Complex administrative arrangements can be problematic as they may interact with other components and/or processes in the power system in ways that are unforeseen and unintended.

### Existing and emerging challenges in the design process {#sec:lit_review-design-challenges}

#### Variable renewable energy and inverter-based resources

Many jurisdictions are presently experiencing or are soon expected to experience high instantaneous penetrations of VRE resources and IBRs [@australianenergymarketoperatorMaintainingPowerSystem2019; @matevosyanFutureInverterBasedResources2021; @elaElectricityMarketFuture2021]. These resources pose challenges to power system balancing as VRE resources introduce additional variability & uncertainty, and because IBRs do not provide an inherent or controlled response to frequency deviations unless they are explicitly configured to do so. I elaborate on these challenges in [@sec:fcs-intro], [@sec:fcs-ibr-challenges] and [@sec:reserves-intro]. These issues are of particular concern to islanded power systems and weakly-interconnected control areas, which cannot rely on or have limited access to a wider synchronous area for balancing assistance [@hodgeAddressingTechnicalChallenges2020].

#### The tension between effectiveness & efficiency

The tension between effectiveness, the primary aim of engineering standards & practices, and efficiency, an outcome championed by economists and often pursued through markets, significantly contributes to the complexity and contested nature of the design process in restructured electricity industries. One perspective of this tension (which I present in [@sec:fcs-intro] & [@sec-reserves-intro] and is extensively discussed by @chaoInterfaceEngineeringMarket2005) is that the efficiency gains obtained through market-based mechanisms for procuring balancing flexibility may come at the expense of the redundancy, certainty and control that a SO might require to guarantee effective balancing. An alternative perspective of this tension is that operational practices that adhere to engineering best-practice (as opposed to passing a cost-benefit test) can, following restructuring, be scrutinised by market participants "because choices of operating standards can severely impact their profits", especially in the case of practices associated with "costs that the [SO] passes to participants via grid management charges" [@chaoInterfaceEngineeringMarket2005, p.1984].

I discuss a parallel tension — between the public good characteristics of electricity supply and the implementation of complete markets for balancing products & services — to this one in the next subsection.

#### "Second-best" on efficiency {#sec:lit_review-design-challenges-secondbest}

Perspectives from both engineering & economics have been invoked in the electricity market design literature when referring to the "second-best" design challenge. @macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020 approach the market design problem with a systems engineering perspective guided by the principle of sub-optimisation, which holds that:

> Optimizing each subsystem independently will not in general lead to a system optimum, or more strongly, improvement of a particular subsystem may actually worsen the overall system [@machol1965system]

@pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019 and @maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021 discuss a similar challenge, but instead invoke Lipsey's "General Theory of Second Best", which states that [@lipseyGeneralTheorySecond1956, p.11]:

> If there is introduced into a general equilibrium system a constraint which prevents the attainment of one of the Paretian conditions, the other Paretian conditions, although still attainable, are, in general, no longer desirable

In other words, if a constraint imposed by technical, social or political factors (these are what many neoclassical economists refer to as "market distortions") or by the construct of the market itself (discussed later in this subsection) prevents conditions and/or features that are necessary for an efficient outcome , then 1) pursuing the other conditions and/or features required by that design does not guarantee an improvement in system welfare (it may, in some cases, even worsen it) and 2) imposing other "market distortions" (often regulatory mechanisms) on the system may actually improve welfare outcomes. For example, "the adoption of a free trade policy by one country, in a multi-country tariff ridden world, may actually lower the real income of that country and of the world" [@lipseyGeneralTheorySecond1956, p.14].

There are several aspects to the design problem that mean that any solution proposed by policy-makers will need to be "second-best". Firstly, as raised in [@sec:fcs-intro] & [@sec:fcs-efficiency-challenges] and demonstrated in [@nahmmacherStrategiesShocksPower2016], there is an asymmetry between the cost[^6] of power system failure due to inadequate balancing flexibility and the cost of measures that the SO can take to mitigate this failure [@lalEssentialSystemServices2021]. Another way to understand this asymmetry is that there are externalities tied to security and reliability ("security-of-supply") that are not reflected in the price of balancing processes, services & products [@macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020; @kepplerWhySustainableProvision2022]. A Coasian lens on the "social cost" of security-of-supply presents a bargaining solution for addressing these externalities in the form of *differentiated reliability* (i.e. consumers of electricity pay for different levels of service) [@billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020; @maysPrivateRiskSocial2022]; however, the issue of equitable access to an essential service and the significant transaction costs[^7] associated with this solution have led to the characterisation of security-of-supply as a public good and the allocation of responsibility for reliability to the SO [@coaseProblemSocialCost1960]. The ultimate outcome here is that effectively meeting a system-wide requirement for reliability requires "distortions" in the markets for the products & services that are required to provide it [@maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021]. For example, many markets for frequency control services are monopsonistic — the SO is the sole buyer and controls market demand, albeit on behalf of the system to ensure that sufficient capabilities are procured for secure & reliable operation [@reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007]. I discuss the role of other "distortions" and market incompleteness in hindering efficient price formation and cost allocation in Australian frequency control markets in [@sec:fcs].

[^6]: I refer here to quantifiable economic costs, but there are of course significant social costs associated with the loss of electricity supply given that it services many direct end-uses and is required by other essential services critical to the health and wellbeing of people [@australianenergymarketoperatorSubmissionAERWALDO2020; @australianenergymarketoperator2020ISPAppendix2020; @prakashResponseCapacityMechanism2022].

[^7]: At least historically, though technological advances are challenging this notion [@borensteinEconomicsElectricityReliability2023; @billimoriaInsuranceMechanismElectricity2022].

Secondly, because unbundled SOs do not have direct control or ownership of generation or demand-side resources (see [@sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms]), policy-makers are hamstrung in situations where balancing flexibility is best provided by the SO. In the context of ancillary services (of which frequency control services are a subset), @pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019 argue that in the absence of limits on SO ownership, Coase's insights on the nature of the firm suggest that transaction costs would determine whether the SO provides ancillary services themselves or outsources their provision via spot market procurement [@coaseNatureFirm1937]:

> [Ancillary services are often] associated with significant uncertainties about how much to procure and may be subject to significant market power within the limited local area that they are needed (especially for voltage support and constraint management) (...) Internal production works well in conditions of uncertainty about how much to procure and/or how the costs of different quality features trade off with each other. In-house production can also be a good way to manage external suppliers who would otherwise exercise market power.

Furthermore, as I discuss in [@sec:fcs-challenges-efficiency] and [@sec:reserves-intro], spot markets work best with well-defined, fungible and discrete *products*, but such products ignore interdependencies and the wide technical capability "spectrum" of power system resources [@gimonGridPhysicsMarkets2020]. The question here is whether the potential benefits of spot market competition & transparency outweigh those of SO co-ordination & a more nuanced approach. Co-ordination is particularly desirable for  balancing flexibility services that are "lumpy" and/or inseparable from other services. For example, mechanical inertia provision requires the commitment of synchronous generation, which in turn augments rotor angle stability and system strength [@billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020].

In practice, long-term bilateral contracts constitute a "second-best" solution used by SOs to procure balancing flexibility under the conditions outlined above [@pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019]. If there are benefits to be gained from competitive pressure, such contracts can be awarded following a tender process [@reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007].

#### The design problem is underdetermined

The design problem for balancing practices is often *underdetermined*, i.e. it has many possible solutions. As I argue in [@sec:reserves-intro], this is because some processes, services & markets have overlapping roles and functions. One of the challenges that arises from a wide solution space is assessing the various trade-offs between minimising complexity, reducing constraints on the system and accounting for the interdependency, interoperability and interchangeability of balancing practices.

#### Grid architectures
various grid architectures have been proposed that enable smaller and distributed consumer-owned energy resources to respond to real-time pricing or even participate in real-time markets, be they at Tx or Dx level.
From the design process perspective, enabling these grid architectures requires forward-looking design. One way to achieve this is to maximise design flexibility by minimising constraints imposed by operational practices and thus retaining option value. 

#### Diversity of initial conditions & outcomes

The design process has proceeded differently across jurisdictions (refer to @papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018 and @ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022) due, in part, to technological, infrastructural, institutional and behavioural differences. These differences are likely to persist as jurisdictions revisit their balancing practices due to the *path dependency* of energy systems ( i.e. initial "lock-ins" have a large bearing on what system trajectories and futures are possible) [@fouquetPathDependenceEnergy2016]. Diversity of initial conditions & outcomes poses a challenge to the design problem as policy-makers in one jurisdiction must judge the experiences with a particular balancing practice in another jurisdiction within context. In other words, learning from experiences in other jurisdictions is not straightforward.

## Conclusion

Frequency control is vital to the secure operation of a power system.
The inherent characteristics and control systems of IBR differ from
those of synchronous machines and this poses both opportunities and
challenges to frequency control arrangements in mandatory pool markets
with growing instantaneous penetrations of IBR. The frequency control
performance of a power system is highly influenced by the frequency
control strategy, which consists of the control mechanisms, electricity
market design and the regulatory mechanisms that are in place, and the
frequency control capability of its resources. Determining the
appropriate combination of these mechanisms will require examining the
interfaces between market-based, regulatory and control mechanisms and
identifying the benefits, costs and trade-offs associated with
particular design choices. This will enable electricity market designers
to make an informed choice in implementing effective and efficient
frequency control arrangements in low-carbon electricity markets.
