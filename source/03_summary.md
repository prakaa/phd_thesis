# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Decarbonisation requires an unprecedented deployment of variable renewable energy (VRE) in the form of solar photovoltaic and wind generation. As such, power systems worldwide are soon expected to experience, or indeed already experiencing high instantaneous penetrations of VRE. Given that these resources pose challenges but also present opportunities to the effective and efficient balancing of active power supply and demand in power systems, policy-makers worldwide are revisiting the design and configuration of power system operational practices such as grid codes, system operator processes and, in jurisdictions that have introduced wholesale competition, electricity markets.

In this thesis, I explore how policy-makers should design operational practices for balancing electricity markets given existing challenges and those posed by growing penetrations of VRE. Because the design process is complex, contested and contextual, I employ an empirical approach to studying aspects of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), the power system and electricity market that services the vast majority of the country's electricity demand, that identifies flexible and practical design solutions. Though I focus on the Australian NEM, which offers an excellent case study given that it regularly experiences high instantaneous penetrations of VRE, I also provide policy-makers in other jurisdictions with valuable insights drawn from the Australian experience and a framework for approaching the design of operational balancing practices in electricity markets undergoing transition.

Frequency control services are a significant component of a system operator's balancing toolkit and are critical to ensuring that imbalances are quickly addressed. In this thesis, I first explore what features are needed in centrally-coordinated arrangements for procuring frequency control services during energy transition. Through a comprehensive review of international frequency control arrangements and an assessment of the Australian NEM's frequency control arrangements, I offer four insights on designing frequency control arrangements as power system capabilities and needs change: 1) Understanding control action interactions, 2) Implementing efficient price formation and cost-allocation mechanisms, 3) Monitoring and assessing service provision to better align participant remuneration with service quality, and 4) Considering both regulatory and market mechanisms and their consequences and interactions.

In wholesale electricity markets, market participation decisions determine the type and quantity of balancing flexibility available within scheduling timeframes. Decentralised operational balancing practices, such as markets, should be assessed to determine whether they are purpose-fit to deliver the balancing flexibility requirements of electricity markets in transition. As a first step in assessing the suitability and design of more decentralised operational balancing practices, I investigate how balancing flexibility capabilities in scheduling timeframes are changing during energy transition. Using a practical method to quantify the time-varying spectrum of upwards and downwards flexibility capabilities of historical and projected resource mixes in two regions of the Australian NEM, I find that with high penetrations of VRE: 1) downwards flexibility margins can be exhausted around noon if wind and solar are unable or unwilling to provide it, 2) upwards flexibility becomes more scarce during morning and evening peak demand events and 3) a greater portion of upwards flexibility is provided by energy-limited resources. Based on these findings, I then recommend that policy-makers examine how existing operational practices can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility provision, and that duration specifications and sustained footroom procurement be considered for reserve products.

Understanding the quantity of balancing flexibility available in a power system is inadequate if market participants are unable or unwilling to offer it into the wholesale spot market. As such, I shift to exploring how more decentralised operational balancing practices can be configured to maximise the deployability of balancing flexibility in scheduling timeframes. I do so by examining whether market knowledge processes, which provide market participants with current and forecasted power system and market information, and market participation rules in the Australian NEM are purpose-fit to enable the effective and efficient scheduling of energy storage resources – resources critical to balancing high renewables power systems through energy arbitrage. From an analysis of the centralised price forecasts generated by the NEM's system and market operator, I find that errors in these forecasts are increasing in frequency and severity and, as such, arbitrage revenues can be reduced by 15-60+% should these forecasts be used to guide battery energy storage scheduling. I then investigate whether market participant (re)bidding is responsible for this phenomenon, and subsequently discuss changes to participant scheduling strategies and market design that could improve scheduling outcomes. I recommend that Australian policy-makers not only increase the frequency at which centralised knowledge processes are run, but also consider whether stricter market participation restrictions might incentivise participant bidding strategies that are less likely to induce sudden price forecast swings that can hamper effective scheduling.
