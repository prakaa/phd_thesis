\section{Power systems}\label{sec:lit_review-power_systems}}

Given the welfare and economic benefits associated with electricity
access, many 20\textsuperscript{th} century states constructed large
bulk \emph{power systems} to leverage investment \& operational
economies of scale. These systems sought to efficiently deliver active
power (i.e.~power that does work) to numerous electricity end-users
(\emph{demand} or \emph{loads}) from electricity suppliers (
\emph{generators}) across vast distances. A typical power system
configuration is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:elec_supply_chain}.
Generators supply the system with alternating current (AC) power either
through a direct electromagnetic connection or through a power inverter
interface (which converts the direct current, or DC, produced by the
generator to AC). AC power is then efficiently transmitted over long
distances through a high voltage \emph{transmission} system. As
transmission lines approach load centres, voltages are stepped down to
make power delivery to the houses and businesses connected to the lower
voltage \emph{distribution system} safer
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mastersRenewableEfficientElectric2004}{Masters,
2004}).

\hypertarget{synchronous-and-control-areas}{%
\subsection{Synchronous and control
areas}\label{synchronous-and-control-areas}}

A network area that is operated at a (constant) nominal AC frequency is
known as a \emph{synchronous area}. During stable operation, AC
frequency should be close to the system's nominal value and more-or-less
uniform across the synchronous area. A \emph{control area}, on the other
hand, is a network area in which a \emph{system operator} (SO) is
responsible for maintaining a balance between supply and demand for
electrical power. Whether the term ``power system'' refers to a
synchronous area or a control area is often dependent on context --- in
particular, the relationship between the two in the jurisdiction in
question. In eastern and southern Australia, the National Electricity
Market's (NEM) single control area consists of two synchronous areas
(see Section~\ref{sec:fcs-nem} for further detail). In contrast, other
jurisdictions have a single synchronous area composed of several
electrically-connected control areas demarcated by political rather than
physical boundaries. For example, continental Europe is a single
synchronous area consisting of many national or trans-national control
areas, and the continental United States has three synchronous areas
(two of which extend into Canada) with over 60 control areas
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-northamericanelectricreliabilitycorporationNERCInterconnections2023}{North
American Electric Reliability Corporation, 2023};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-schittekatteDistributedEnergyResources2022}{Schittekatte
and Pototschnig, 2022})

\hypertarget{power-system-operations}{%
\section{Power system operations}\label{power-system-operations}}

In broad terms, \emph{operating} a power system involves the direction
or control of \emph{power system resources} --- generators, loads,
network elements and energy storage resources (which can act as both a
generator and a load). In practice, however, power system operation is
inseparable from the economic objective imposed upon SOs: minimise
system costs (or under some market paradigms described in
Section~\ref{sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms}, maximise the value
of trade) whilst 1) continuously maintaining a balance between active
power supply \& demand and 2) ensuring that system resources \& the
system itself are operated within their respective technical envelopes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-woodPowerGenerationOperation2014}{Wood et al.,
2014}). The latter constraint implies \emph{stable} \& \emph{secure}
operation and is a prerequisite for the former constraint, which
more-or-less corresponds to \emph{reliable} operation\footnote{The term
  \emph{balancing services} is used in European systems, whereas the
  term \emph{operating reserves} is widely used in North America.}.

Noting that planning \& investment have a large bearing on the manner in
which a power system is operated (and vice versa),
Figure~\ref{fig:power_system_timeframes} presents a high-level overview
of power system phenomena and processes, services \& markets that are
most pertinent to active power balancing in operational timeframes, with
those discussed in detail within this thesis highlighted in bold red
text.

\hypertarget{phenomena-in-operational-timeframes}{%
\subsection{Phenomena in operational
timeframes}\label{phenomena-in-operational-timeframes}}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:power_system_timeframes}, power system
operations is concerned with phenomena that dominate on timescales
ranging from a few milliseconds to several months
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hatziargyriouDefinitionClassificationPower2021}{Hatziargyriou
et al., 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020}{Machowski et
al., 2020}):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Electromagnetic} phenomena arise from the coupling of electrical
  and magnetic fields within \emph{synchronous machines} (generators and
  motors that rotate at a speed proportional to AC frequency) and
  between power system resources. They occur on the timescale of
  milliseconds to seconds. Controls for \emph{inverter-based resources},
  which have a power electronic inverter interface to the wider power
  system, also operate in this timeframe.
\item
  \emph{Electromechanical} phenomena are slower (seconds to minutes
  timescale) and arise as a result of electromagnetic fields interacting
  with rotating masses and mechanical forces. These typically occur in
  motors and generators.
\item
  \emph{Thermodynamic} phenomena are slower still. They encompass
  chemical fuel conversion \& heat transfer processes in boilers. These
  phenomena occur over multiple timeframes, from seconds to minutes to
  hours. I will also extend this category to include the dynamic
  behaviour of the primary energy sources for hydroelectricity and
  \emph{variable renewable energy} (VRE), which primarily refers to wind
  and solar photovoltaic (PV) generation.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms}{%
\subsection{Operational
paradigms}\label{sec:lit_review-operational_paradigms}}

Synchronous areas can be subdivided into \emph{control areas}, which are
typically demarcated by the network boundaries of separate electric
utilities or electricity markets
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Grainger1994}{\textbf{Grainger1994?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Elgerd1971}{\textbf{Elgerd1971?}}). Within a
control area, the control of AC frequency is the responsibility of a
system operator.

\hypertarget{vertically-integrated}{%
\subsubsection{Vertically-integrated}\label{vertically-integrated}}

Historically, this configuration enabled economies of scale in both
asset investment and operation to be achieved by electric utilities,
particularly regulated monopolies that owned and operated most, if not
all, of the generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure
within a power system and were responsible for the retail of electricity
to the end-user (these regulated monopolies are known as
vertically-integrated utilities)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Masters2004}{\textbf{Masters2004?}}).

\hypertarget{restructuring-and-the-emergence-of-wholesale-electricity-markets}{%
\subsubsection{Restructuring and the emergence of wholesale electricity
markets}\label{restructuring-and-the-emergence-of-wholesale-electricity-markets}}

In mandatory pool markets, the system operator commits and dispatches
individual generators (and, in some cases, loads) in the day-ahead and
real-time markets, respectively, based on economic optimisation
processes that incorporate transmission constraints and stability and
reliability requirements. These processes are \emph{security-constrained
unit commitment} (SCUC), which is executed in the day-ahead market, and
\emph{security-constrained economic dispatch} (SCED), which is executed
just prior to the relevant real-time market interval. In many mandatory
pool markets, SCED and SCUC co-optimise the provision of energy and
frequency control services

It should be noted that these processes are not exclusive to mandatory
pool markets and could be used by vertically-integrated utilities to
efficiently schedule resources in the power system
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Grainger1994}{\textbf{Grainger1994?}}).

\hypertarget{electricity-industry-restructuring}{%
\paragraph{Electricity industry
restructuring}\label{electricity-industry-restructuring}}

Beginning in the early 1990s, perceived inefficiencies and overspend by
monopoly electric utilities, advancements in small low-upfront cost gas
turbine technologies and the successful liberalisation of other
industries such as airlines and telecommunications prompted many
countries to restructure their electricity industries
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Weigt2009}{\textbf{Weigt2009?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Miller2017}{\textbf{Miller2017?}}). A common
feature of this process across power systems was the implementation of a
wholesale market for electricity, where generators compete for the
opportunity to supply electricity and earn revenue through an
auction-based mechanism
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Milligan2017}{\textbf{Milligan2017?}}).

\hypertarget{electricity-market-structures-and-features}{%
\paragraph{Electricity market structures and
features}\label{electricity-market-structures-and-features}}

\hypertarget{system-operator}{%
\subparagraph{System operator}\label{system-operator}}

In restructured electricity industries, the implementation of wholesale
markets was accompanied by the creation of an independent power system
operator to operate the transmission network, manage and administer the
electricity market, maintain short-term power system \emph{reliability}
(the ability to meet demand with supply) and \emph{security} (the
ability to operate the power system within a defined operating
envelope), and carry out longer term planning functions
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sioshansi2006}{\textbf{Sioshansi2006?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hogan2008}{\textbf{Hogan2008?}}). These entities
may own transmission infrastructure as a regulated monopoly, as is the
case with the various Transmission System Operators (TSOs) in Europe, or
be independent of any infrastructure ownership, such as the Independent
System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Operators (RTOs) in
North America and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).

\hypertarget{market-models}{%
\subparagraph{Market models}\label{market-models}}

The restructuring process proceeded differently across jurisdictions,
resulting in the implementation of different wholesale market
mechanisms. However, at a higher level, electricity markets worldwide
have generally converged towards two main market models which are
distinguished by the degree of centralisation of market operations and
the role of the system operator
(\protect\hyperlink{fig:market_models}{2}):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Decentralised \emph{bilateral markets}, in which suppliers enter into
  contracts with buyers either directly or through intermediaries
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Barroso2005}{\textbf{Barroso2005?}}). Whilst
  scheduling and dispatch is managed by market participants, intended
  energy schedules (i.e.~net contract positions) are submitted by market
  participants ahead of time to the system operator, who is responsible
  for determining the requirement for and procuring frequency control
  services (known as balancing services in bilateral markets)
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hirth2015}{\textbf{Hirth2015?}}). This model
  is the dominant market model in Europe.
\item
  Centralised \emph{mandatory power pool markets}, in which offers to
  generate are aggregated into a single supply curve and are cleared
  against a demand forecast (one-sided pool) or against an aggregated
  demand curve constructed from potential buyers (two-sided pool) by the
  system operator
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Barroso2005}{\textbf{Barroso2005?}}). In these
  markets, locational marginal prices for energy and frequency control
  services are produced by centralised optimisation processes run by the
  system operator that consider the physical constraints of the
  transmission system
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cramton2017}{\textbf{Cramton2017?}}). The
  Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) and the ISO/RTO markets
  in North America have adopted this type of market model.
\end{enumerate}

The difference between these mechanisms is whether real-time generation
instructions (\emph{dispatch}) or scheduling decisions (an outcome of
\emph{unit commitment} processes) are determined centrally by the system
operator or are decentralised, with decisions made by market
participants. It is important to note, however, that the adoption of one
model does not preclude the integration of aspects of the other.
Bilateral contracts (in the form of derivatives) are often used as
hedging instruments in mandatory pool markets and several bilateral
markets, such as those in Europe, have associated voluntary power
exchanges that are essentially power pools
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Barroso2005}{\textbf{Barroso2005?}}).

\hypertarget{market-platforms}{%
\subparagraph{Market platforms}\label{market-platforms}}

Whilst other commodity markets are settled continuously or sequentially,
reliability and security considerations and concerns have led to
electricity markets being divided into discrete \emph{platforms}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Isemonger2006}{\textbf{Isemonger2006?}}).
Platforms are formal sub-markets for energy that are settled at
different times. A platform implemented by all electricity markets is a
real-time, or spot, market. Where implemented, additional platforms
involve trade for one or more real-time market intervals but are each
settled at different times ahead of the spot market. These additional
platforms can reduce uncertainty for the system operator and provide
market participants with a formal market mechanism for managing risk
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Isemonger2006}{\textbf{Isemonger2006?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-EnergySecurityBoard2020c}{\textbf{EnergySecurityBoard2020c?}}).

The number and type of platforms a particular market implements is often
related to its market model. European bilateral markets often have a
real-time market, a day-ahead market and intra-day markets, where
day-ahead commitments may be traded continuously between market
participants
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ahlqvist2018Central-Markets}{\textbf{Ahlqvist2018Central-Markets?}}).
In contrast, however, it is practical to limit the number of platforms
in a mandatory pool market due to the inflexibility of commitment
`contracts' determined by computationally complex optimisation processes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Isemonger2006}{\textbf{Isemonger2006?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ahlqvist2018Central-Markets}{\textbf{Ahlqvist2018Central-Markets?}}).
North American ISO/RTO markets have two platforms - a financially
binding day-ahead market and a physically and financially binding
real-time spot market
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cramton2017}{\textbf{Cramton2017?}}). The
Australian NEM is rather unique amongst mandatory pool markets as it
only has a single platform - the real-time spot market. This arrangement
means that while dispatch is centralised, participants manage the
commitment of their generation portfolio with the assistance of
pre-dispatch forecasts provided by AEMO
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Riesz2016a}{\textbf{Riesz2016a?}}).

\hypertarget{active-power-balancing}{%
\section{Active power balancing}\label{active-power-balancing}}

In theory, \emph{active power balancing} is simply a consequence of the
law of conservation of energy: the energy supplied through primary
energy conversion or by energy storage into a network node is equal to
the sum of the energy dissipated, stored and consumed at the same
network node at each and every moment. In practice, however, it involves
the \textbf{\emph{moment-to-moment control} of generation and loads to
balance active power supply and demand \emph{across the power system}}.
\emph{Moment-to-moment control} is required because it is still
uneconomical in many jurisdictions to store electricity at scale
(i.e.~in the same order of magnitude as generation and demand) despite
grid-scale storage cost reductions
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-internationalenergyagencyGridScaleStorage2022}{International
Energy Agency, 2022}), and though electricity can be transported close
to the speed of light across the network, balancing required
coordination \emph{across the power system} because of transmission
losses and network constraints imposed by line thermal limits, stability
requirements \& Kirchoff's circuit laws
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hirthWhyWindNot2016a}{Hirth et al., 2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kirschenFundamentalsPowerSystem2004}{Kirschen and
Strbac, 2004}).

\hypertarget{why-is-it-required}{%
\subsection{Why is it required?}\label{why-is-it-required}}

Unlike the transportation networks of many other commodities, an
imbalance between active power supply \& demand can lead to deviations
in technical parameters --- voltage and frequency --- that not only have
the potential to damage equipment connected to the power system, but
also to trigger a system collapse
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-borensteinEconomicsElectricityReliability2023}{Borenstein
et al., 2023}). As such, maintaining active power balance is essential
to proper resource and system functioning.

\hypertarget{the-relationship-between-active-power-balance-ac-frequency}{%
\subsubsection{The relationship between active power balance \& AC
frequency}\label{the-relationship-between-active-power-balance-ac-frequency}}

Because synchronous machines are present in most power systems, system
active power balance is closely tied to the system's AC frequency.
During steady state operation, synchronous machines rotate at a
\emph{synchronous speed} (\(N_s\)) that is proportional to the nominal
system frequency (\(f\)) (Equation~\ref{eq:synch_speed})
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chapmanElectricMachineryFundamentals2011}{Chapman,
2011}):

\[N_s = \frac{120f}{P} \label{eq:synch_speed}\]

where \(N_s\) is the synchronous speed in revolutions per minute, \(P\)
is the number of (rotor) magnetic poles and \(f\) is the electrical
frequency in hertz.

The link between active power imbalance and synchronous speed/system
frequency can be elucidated by examining synchronous machine dynamics.
In a synchronous generator (coal-fired, gas-fired and hydro generators),
the interaction between the interacting magnetic fields of the rotor and
stator produces an electromagnetic torque (\(T_e\)) on the rotor that
opposes the mechanical torque (\(T_m\)) supplied by a prime mover
(e.g.~steam turbine) (Figure~\ref{fig:synch_torques}).
Equation~\ref{eq:swing}, which is an energy balance variation of what is
known as the \emph{swing equation}, shows that if there is a transient
increase in the electrical load of the power system (equivalent to an
increase in \(P_e\) and thus \(T_e\)), the rotor of a synchronous
generator will begin to decelerate as its stored kinetic energy is
converted to electrical energy
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elgerdElectricEnergySystems1971}{Elgerd, 1971};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994}{Grainger,
1994}).

\[J\omega_{sm}\frac{d\omega_{sm}}{dt} = P_m - P_e \label{eq:swing}\]

where \(\omega_{sm}\) is the synchronous machine rotor shaft velocity,
\(J\) is moment of inertia of the rotor, \(P_m\) is mechanical power,
\(T_m\) is mechanical torque, \(P_e\) is electrical power and \(T_e\) is
electromagnetic torque.

\begin{figure}

the interaction of the rotor and stator magnetic fields. Source: Rebours

}
\end{figure}

The relationship between the active power imbalance in a power system
(\(P_{gen}-P_{load}\)) and AC frequency is obtained by extending the
dynamics of the swing equation from a single synchronous generator to
all synchronous generators in a synchronous area
(Equation~\ref{eq:swing_area}). Equation~\ref{eq:swing_area} shows that
the rate of change of frequency (\emph{RoCoF}) is proportional to the
active power imbalance and inversely proportional to the system's
inertia constant, \(H\). This form of the swing equation only models the
\emph{inertial response} of synchronous generators, and not the
\emph{load damping} response offered by (frequency-dependent) induction
motor loads. Generation inertial response typically plays a large role
in electromechanical system dynamics as the high speed and mass of
generator rotors mean that they store significant quantities of kinetic
energy (\protect\hyperlink{ref-denholmInertiaPowerGrid2020}{Denholm et
al., 2020}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-ulbigImpactLowRotational2014}{Ulbig
et al., 2014}).

\[\frac{2H}{f}\frac{df}{dt} = \frac{P_{gen}-P_{load}}{S_{g, total}} \label{eq:swing_area}\]

where \(H\) is the inertia constant of the synchronous area
(\(H=\sum_{g} H_g\), where \(H_g = \frac{J_g(2\pi f)^2}{2S_g}\)), \(f\)
is the AC frequency, \(\frac{df}{dt}\) is the rate of change of
frequency or RoCoF, \(S_{g,total}\) is the total apparent power of
synchronous generators, and \(P_{gen}\) and \(P_{load}\) are the
system's total power supply and total power demand (including losses),
respectively.

Equation~\ref{eq:swing_area} also shows that a power system's AC
frequency is an indicator of active power balance
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bagginiHandbookPowerQuality2008}{Baggini,
2008}). Insufficient generation will lead to a decrease in system
frequency (i.e.~negative RoCoF) and oversupply will lead to an increase
in system frequency (i.e.~positive RoCoF).

\hypertarget{the-consequences-of-frequency-deviations}{%
\subsubsection{The consequences of frequency
deviations}\label{the-consequences-of-frequency-deviations}}

Serious power system frequency deviations away from the nominal value
can have harmful effects. Synchronous machines may experience
equipment-damaging vibrations
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-ulbigImpactLowRotational2014}{Ulbig et al.,
2014}), and both synchronous machines and transformers can overheat and
fail if they operate outside their rated voltage-frequency limits
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kirbyFrequencyControlConcerns2002}{Kirby et al.,
2002}). Synchronous machines are also vulnerable to damage from high
RoCoFs due to pole slipping
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016}{DGA
Consulting, 2016}). For these reasons, frequency-sensitive relays are
often used to protect power system resources from frequency excursions.

However, these same protection measures can also trigger the complete
collapse of the power system. Should the disconnection of a resource
following a relay trip exacerbate an existing active power imbalance,
the system frequency may deviate further and result in further
disconnections. Situations such as these are known as \emph{cascading
failures} and can lead to a total system collapse (a \emph{blackout}).
Blackouts can have devastating social \& economic consequences and
require long \& complex system restoration procedures before the power
system can be returned to normal operation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kirschenFundamentalsPowerSystem2004}{Kirschen
and Strbac, 2004}). As such, SOs often employ emergency frequency
control schemes that trip loads in the event of under-frequency
(\emph{under-frequency load shedding} or \emph{UFLS}) or generation in
the event of over-frequency (\emph{over-frequency generation shedding}
or \emph{OFGS}) as a last line of defence against frequency-driven
system collapse
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021a};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hartmannEffectsDecreasingSynchronous2019}{Hartmann
et al., 2019}).

\hypertarget{threats-to-system-balance}{%
\subsection{Threats to system balance}\label{threats-to-system-balance}}

As highlighted in
\protect\hyperlink{eq:swing_area}{{[}eq:swing\_area{]}}, the AC
frequency of a power system can deviate from its nominal value when
there is an imbalance between power supply and demand in the synchronous
area. Active power imbalances are the result of power system
\emph{variability} and \emph{uncertainty}.

\hypertarget{variability}{%
\subsubsection{Variability}\label{variability}}

Variability refers to expected or forecast fluctuations in the balance
of active power supply and demand
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2011}{\textbf{Ela2011?}}). Sources of
variability include fluctuations in load, oscillatory active power
output from synchronous generators and changing weather conditions
(e.g.~cloud cover, wind speed) that may affect the active power output
of VRE (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2011}{\textbf{Ela2011?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bloom2017}{\textbf{Bloom2017?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Riesz2015a}{\textbf{Riesz2015a?}}).

\hypertarget{uncertainty}{%
\subsubsection{Uncertainty}\label{uncertainty}}

Uncertainty refers to unexpected fluctuations in the balance of active
power supply and demand
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2011}{\textbf{Ela2011?}}). Power system
uncertainty encompasses the unanticipated behaviour of generators, loads
and network elements. This includes unexpected outages (known as
\emph{contingency events}) and weather forecast errors that lead to VRE
generation forecast error
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2011}{\textbf{Ela2011?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Riesz2015a}{\textbf{Riesz2015a?}})

Power system frequency control is required for the stable operation of a

utcomes

\hypertarget{the-role-of-frequency-control-services}{%
\subsection{The role of frequency control
services}\label{the-role-of-frequency-control-services}}

As discussed in \protect\hyperlink{sec:scuc_sced}{2.4}, SCED is executed
by vertically-integrated utilities and in mandatory pool electricity
markets to ensure that active power supply and demand is efficiently
balanced subject to network constraints and system security and
reliability requirements. Between, and potentially across consecutive
SCED processes (dispatch intervals) and unit commitment schedules,
\emph{frequency control services} are used by the system operator to
manage both small and large instantaneous active power imbalances that
may arise due to variability and uncertainty.

\hypertarget{sec:conventional_freq_control}{%
\subsection{Conventional frequency control scheme and
services}\label{sec:conventional_freq_control}}

Power system operators typically employ a hierarchical and sequential
control scheme to contain AC frequency within as narrow a band as
possible, particularly during contingency events
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Undrill2018}{\textbf{Undrill2018?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2011}{\textbf{Ela2011?}}). This control scheme
involves the use of generation or load units with reserve capacity that
provide frequency control services
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2011}{\textbf{Ela2011?}}). For these units to
mitigate power system frequency deviations, they must have reserve
capacity in the form of \emph{headroom} (the ability to increase active
power output) to respond to an under-frequency event, \emph{footroom}
(the ability to decrease active power output) to respond to an
over-frequency event, or both
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eto2010a}{\textbf{Eto2010a?}}). Under-frequency
events are generally of greater concern to the system operator
(e.g.~loss of large generator). The various frequency control services
differ based on their purpose, activation method, response time and
control method (\protect\hyperlink{fig:freq_control}{5}). In the
following subsections, we outline frequency control services that are
common in many power systems.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{inertial-response}{%
\subsubsection{Inertial response}\label{inertial-response}}

As discussed in \protect\hyperlink{sec:electromech}{3.3.1}, synchronous
machines have an inherent inertial response to AC frequency deviations
that must be considered in the frequency control strategy of a power
system. For a a given active power imbalance, the inertia constant of
the synchronous area, \(H\), determines the magnitude of the initial
RoCoF following a contingency event (see
\protect\hyperlink{eq:swing_area}{{[}eq:swing\_area{]}}) and the speed
at which the power system can be returned to the nominal frequency
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ulbig2014}{\textbf{Ulbig2014?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hartmann2019}{\textbf{Hartmann2019?}}).

\hypertarget{primary-frequency-control}{%
\subsubsection{Primary frequency
control}\label{primary-frequency-control}}

The aim of primary frequency control (PFC) is to arrest the frequency
deviation through the autonomous response of generators and
frequency-responsive demand-response to locally-measured frequency
deviations that exceed a certain control dead-band
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2012b}{\textbf{Ela2012b?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wang2003}{\textbf{Wang2003?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2019e}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2019e?}}).
For generators, this is achieved through \emph{droop control}, in which
a deviation from synchronous speed corresponds to a change in the active
power output of a generator according to its droop characteristic
(\protect\hyperlink{fig:droop}{6}, from A to B along \(L_0\))
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eto2018}{\textbf{Eto2018?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2012b}{\textbf{Ela2012b?}}). Droop control is
implemented through the turbine governors of synchronous generators or
the inverter control system for IBR
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Undrill2018}{\textbf{Undrill2018?}}). Provided
there is a sufficient amount of PFC reserve to arrest the system
frequency, the speed of PFC determines the \emph{frequency zenith} or
\emph{frequency nadir}, which are the maximum or minimum system
frequency, respectively, following an active power imbalance event
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eto2010a}{\textbf{Eto2010a?}}). PFC can be
activated in response to small (tight dead-band) or contingency (wide
dead-band) imbalance events and should ideally be sustained until
secondary frequency control can take over
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eto2018}{\textbf{Eto2018?}}).

\hypertarget{secondary-frequency-control}{%
\subsubsection{Secondary frequency
control}\label{secondary-frequency-control}}

Secondary frequency control (SFC) replaces PFC and can consist of either
or both of a synchronous area secondary control system known as an
\emph{Automatic Generation Control} (AGC) or unit-level load controllers
(the latter is illustrated in \protect\hyperlink{fig:droop}{6})
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Undrill2018}{\textbf{Undrill2018?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eto2018}{\textbf{Eto2018?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Undrill2019}{\textbf{Undrill2019?}}). The most
common strategy is for a synchronous area AGC to implement
proportional-integral control on the Area Control Error (ACE) with a
tie-line bias
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Machowski2020}{\textbf{Machowski2020?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2011}{\textbf{Ela2011?}}). To minimise ACE and
return the power system to its nominal frequency, the AGC sends signals
to SFC units every 4 to 10 seconds to adjust their active power output
in response to a frequency deviation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eto2018}{\textbf{Eto2018?}}). When used to
respond to smaller imbalance events, SFC is typically known as
\emph{regulation} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2011}{\textbf{Ela2011?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hewicker2020}{\textbf{Hewicker2020?}}).

\(\omega_1\) and the turbine governor responds by moving the turbine
along the droop characteristic to point B, thus increasing its active
power output to \(P_{M1}\). Following this, SFC changes the reference
speed setpoint of the governor, moving the droop characteristic to
\(L_1\) and returning the system to frequency \(\omega_0\). Source:

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{tertiary-frequency-control}{%
\subsubsection{Tertiary frequency
control}\label{tertiary-frequency-control}}

Tertiary frequency control (TFC) is intended to replace PFC and SFC. TFC
is typically used as a margin of safety in systems where relatively
infrequent unit commitment or rescheduling processes may be required to
correct an active power imbalance
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hewicker2020}{\textbf{Hewicker2020?}}). Some
systems, such as the NEM, do not procure TFR and instead rely solely
upon a SCED that is frequently executed
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Billimoria2020}{\textbf{Billimoria2020?}}).

\subsubsection{Dispatch and unit

\subsubsection{Security-constrained economic
dispatch}\label{security-constrained-economic-dispatch}}

SCED aims to determine the minimum cost operating configuration for
committed generation such that a short-term forecast or actual demand
can be met subject to subject to network constraints and stability and
reliability requirements
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Grainger1994}{\textbf{Grainger1994?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wood2014}{\textbf{Wood2014?}}). As generators
typically submit offers for generation (and in some cases, frequency
control) as piecewise linear cost functions, the SCED problem is less
computationally complex than SCUC and can be solved using linear
programming techniques
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wood2014}{\textbf{Wood2014?}}). For a given
real-time market interval, SCED produces a set of physically and
financially binding dispatch instructions, which include generation
setpoints and enablement for frequency control services, and locational
marginal prices for energy and frequency control services
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cramton2017}{\textbf{Cramton2017?}}). In
multi-platform markets such as the ISO/RTO markets, SCED is considered a
sub-problem of unit commitment and is run for every real-time market
interval (~5-15 minutes)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wood2014}{\textbf{Wood2014?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-InternationalRenewableEnergyAgency2019}{\textbf{InternationalRenewableEnergyAgency2019?}}).
In single-platform markets, such as the NEM, market participants manage
their own unit commitment and SCED is the only market process that
produces a binding schedule
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyRegulator2016}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyRegulator2016?}}).

\hypertarget{security-constrained-unit-commitment}{%
\subsubsection{Security-constrained unit
commitment}\label{security-constrained-unit-commitment}}

The aim of SCUC is to determine the minimum cost subset of generation
that should be committed (i.e.~synchronised and ready to deliver power
to the power system) to meet a demand forecast for a set of future
market intervals subject to network constraints and stability and
reliability requirements
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wood2014}{\textbf{Wood2014?}}). SCUC is a
computationally complex non-linear problem in many electricity markets
because it considers non-convexities such as start-up costs and minimum
operating costs in addition to an offer for energy
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cramton2017}{\textbf{Cramton2017?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Isemonger2009}{\textbf{Isemonger2009?}}). The
outcomes of solving this problem are an ahead schedule, which is often
only financially binding, and locational marginal prices for energy and
frequency control services for a future set of market intervals, such as
the next day when SCUC is executed in day-ahead markets. SCUC can be
beneficial for market participants that wish to hedge their production
or consumption
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Isemonger2006}{\textbf{Isemonger2006?}}).
Furthermore, it offers certainty around power system outcomes to the
system operator, and around market outcomes to generators that have long
lead times and significant costs associated with commitment
(e.g.~baseload coal power plant) or generators that primarily consider
opportunity costs, rather than marginal costs, when determining whether
it is profitable to provide energy (e.g. hydroelectric power plants,
battery energy storage systems)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wood2014}{\textbf{Wood2014?}};

\hypertarget{sec:ibr_freq}{%
\subsubsection{Inverter-based resources and frequency
control}\label{sec:ibr_freq}}

Inverter-based resources (IBR) include variable IBR (solar PV and Type
III and Type IV wind turbines
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wu2018}{\textbf{Wu2018?}})), BESS and high
voltage direct current (HVDC) links that connect to a power system
through power electronic devices. The impacts of variable IBR on
frequency control are of particular interest to system operators and
market designers as many power systems are currently experiencing high
instantaneous penetrations of variable IBR (in excess of 50\%) and
because many more are expected to do so in the future
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2019}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2019?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-IRENA2020}{\textbf{IRENA2020?}}).

\hypertarget{challenges-posed-by-inverter-based-resources}{%
\paragraph{Challenges posed by inverter-based
resources}\label{challenges-posed-by-inverter-based-resources}}

High penetrations of IBR in power systems pose challenges to frequency
control due to their characteristics, particularly in islanded power
systems or weakly-interconnected control areas that cannot rely on a
wider synchronous area for frequency control services
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hodge2020}{\textbf{Hodge2020?}}). These include
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kroposki2019}{\textbf{Kroposki2019?}}):

\hypertarget{interface-to-power-system}{%
\subparagraph{Interface to power
system}\label{interface-to-power-system}}

As IBR interface to a synchronous area through inverters, they are not
electromagnetically coupled to the power system and therefore do not
exhibit the inherent inertial response of synchronous generators. This
has two main implications. The first is that reduced inertial response
may affect power system stability during transients (e.g.~rotor angle
stability) (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tielens2016}{\textbf{Tielens2016?}}),
and the second is that a lack of inertia in the power system can lead to
higher RoCoF and therefore more severe frequency nadirs or zeniths and
the tripping of emergency protection schemes that would otherwise not
occur in high inertia systems
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Machowski2020}{\textbf{Machowski2020?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ulbig2014}{\textbf{Ulbig2014?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hartmann2019}{\textbf{Hartmann2019?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Dreidy2017}{\textbf{Dreidy2017?}}).

\hypertarget{variability-and-uncertainty}{%
\subparagraph{Variability and
uncertainty}\label{variability-and-uncertainty}}

The aggregate degree of power system variability and uncertainty is
likely to increase with higher penetrations of variable IBR
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Riesz2015a}{\textbf{Riesz2015a?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2020b}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2020b?}}).
Variability not only encompasses active power output variability during
a dispatch interval, which depends on the primary energy source and
plant location and configuration, but also includes large ramps due to
the correlated active power output of variable IBR over longer
timeframes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Keeratimahat2019a}{\textbf{Keeratimahat2019a?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2020d}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2020d?}}).
Power system uncertainty will depend on the accuracy of weather and
generation forecasting, generator reliability and may also be a function
of the degree of visibility and control a system operator has over IBR,
particularly distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar PV and
electric vehicles
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2020d}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2020d?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wurth2019}{\textbf{Wurth2019?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2020m}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2020m?}}).

\hypertarget{provision-of-frequency-control-services}{%
\paragraph{Provision of frequency control
services}\label{provision-of-frequency-control-services}}

The presence of synchronous machines and grid-following inverters makes
inertial response and frequency control necessary for secure and stable
operation of a power system. At high instantaneous penetrations, low
short-run marginal cost IBR may displace synchronous generators that
have traditionally provided inertial response and frequency control
services, and the load damping response may be minimal
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Riesz2015a}{\textbf{Riesz2015a?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tielens2012}{\textbf{Tielens2012?}}). In these
cases, the instantaneous inertia constant of the system may be low and
IBR may be needed to assist in frequency control
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hartmann2019}{\textbf{Hartmann2019?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tielens2012}{\textbf{Tielens2012?}}). Through
their inverter control system, IBR are able exercise rapid and precise
control of their active power, within the constraints of primary or
stored energy, to provide what is known as \emph{fast frequency
response} (FFR)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Machowski2020}{\textbf{Machowski2020?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hodge2020}{\textbf{Hodge2020?}}).

\hypertarget{fast-frequency-response}{%
\subparagraph{Fast frequency response}\label{fast-frequency-response}}

FFR can generally be provided within a matter of milliseconds to provide
a sustained active power response similar to PFC or to mitigate high
RoCoF events (\protect\hyperlink{ref-AEMO2017a}{\textbf{AEMO2017a?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Miller2017}{\textbf{Miller2017?}}). In response
to an under-frequency event, a sustained active power raise response,
similar to PFC, can be achieved by implementing frequency droop control
in the inverter of a BESS, or that of a variable IBR that has been
\emph{deloaded} to provide headroom. Wind turbines can be deloaded
through pitch angle or over speed control, whereas solar PV is typically
deloaded through over-voltage control
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Dreidy2017}{\textbf{Dreidy2017?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tielens2012}{\textbf{Tielens2012?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Fernandez-Guillamon2019a}{\textbf{Fernandez-Guillamon2019a?}}).
A sustained lower response can be delivered by operating an inverter
control system at an off-maximum power point to reduce the IBR's active
power output.

High RoCoF can be mitigated by FFR that is delivered through processes
and controls that mimic the inertial response of a synchronous generator
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eriksson2018}{\textbf{Eriksson2018?}}).
Inertia-based FFR (otherwise known as \emph{synthetic inertia} in the
literature) is provided by extracting the kinetic energy from a wind
turbine rotor to rapidly inject active power
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Miller2017}{\textbf{Miller2017?}}) into the
power system. FFR from \emph{virtual inertia}, on the other hand, is
provided as the result of implementing the dynamic model of a
synchronous machine to some degree within an inverter control system
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tamrakar2017}{\textbf{Tamrakar2017?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Anderson-Cook2013}{\textbf{Anderson-Cook2013?}}).
As FFR requires some form of measurement and is not inherent, it cannot
be considered to be a direct substitute for inertial response
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Miller2017}{\textbf{Miller2017?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AEMO2017a}{\textbf{AEMO2017a?}}).

practices}\label{designing-operational-practices}}

\hypertarget{sec:procurement}{%
\subsubsection{Procurement of frequency control
services}\label{sec:procurement}}

As highlighted by (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2012b}{\textbf{Ela2012b?}})
and (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Billimoria2020}{\textbf{Billimoria2020?}}),
frequency control services are typically procured through a combination
of market-based mechanisms, such as remunerative schemes or contract or
spot markets, and regulatory mechanisms, such as connection requirements
or system operator intervention.

\hypertarget{sec:market_mech}{%
\paragraph{Market-based mechanisms}\label{sec:market_mech}}

\hypertarget{suitability-of-markets}{%
\subparagraph{Suitability of markets}\label{suitability-of-markets}}

Many restructured electricity industries have developed competitive
\emph{ancillary services} markets that enable frequency control services
to be procured alongside \emph{primary} markets for energy and/or
capacity provision. Competitive markets are a suitable mechanism for
procuring frequency control services as AC frequency is a global
parameter and, as such, frequency control services can be provided by
any capable resource within a synchronous area
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Billimoria2020}{\textbf{Billimoria2020?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hirst1998}{\textbf{Hirst1998?}}). This supports
greater participation and competition in frequency control markets.
Furthermore, frequency control services and energy are essentially the
same commodity (active power) but differentiated by their delivery
methods, with the former providing reserve capacity that responds in the
event of a frequency deviation and the latter providing sustained
delivery of active power during a market interval. Given that these
products are related, there are benefits related to reducing overall
system costs, incentivising frequency control provision and improving
trade outcomes for market participants by \emph{co-optimising} markets
for energy and frequency control services
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2016}{\textbf{Ela2016?}}).

\hypertarget{opportunity-costs-and-co-optimisation}{%
\subparagraph{Opportunity costs and
co-optimisation}\label{opportunity-costs-and-co-optimisation}}

To provide raise frequency control services, generation must allocate
reserve capacity, which may be at the expense of profitable energy
provision (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Raineri2006}{\textbf{Raineri2006?}}).
As such, participation in ancillary services markets often entails an
\emph{opportunity cost} to market participants. While frequency control
services markets are often co-optimised with energy markets to ensure
that power system energy supply and security requirements are met at the
lowest cost to the system, participant opportunity costs can be
accounted for in two ways in mandatory pool electricity markets:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In \emph{partially co-optimised} frequency control services markets,
  perceived opportunity costs are incorporated into bids by market
  participant. The procurement of frequency control services and energy
  is co-optimised by the system operator in SCUC and/or SCED, thereby
  minimising overall costs to the system
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Isemonger2009}{\textbf{Isemonger2009?}}).
\item
  In \emph{fully co-optimised} frequency control services markets,
  market participants submit bids for energy and frequency control
  services provision. The system operator then determines a price for
  frequency control services that is the sum of the bid offer and the
  opportunity cost of that resource foregoing provision of energy or
  other services. The system operator can then co-optimise all bids and
  costs in SCUC and/or SCED so as to simultaneously maximise profit for
  market participants whilst minimising overall costs to the system
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2012a}{\textbf{Ela2012a?}};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-IntelligentEnergySystems2010a}{\textbf{IntelligentEnergySystems2010a?}}).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{potential-benefits-of-market-based-mechanisms}{%
\subparagraph{Potential benefits of market-based
mechanisms}\label{potential-benefits-of-market-based-mechanisms}}

Compensation for frequency control services addresses the externality of
providing ancillary services, particularly if the compensation is
aligned with a market participant's opportunity costs
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rebours2007b}{\textbf{Rebours2007b?}}).
Furthermore, if compensation is delivered through market-based
mechanisms and if these mechanisms are designed well, frequency control
services can be procured at least cost to the system from resources that
are best placed to provide them within an operational timeframe
(\emph{productive} efficiency) and spur efficient investment in
frequency control capabilities by market participants into the future
(\emph{dynamic} efficiency)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Thorncraft2007}{\textbf{Thorncraft2007?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Riesz2015b}{\textbf{Riesz2015b?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Biggar2014TheMarkets}{\textbf{Biggar2014TheMarkets?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2020a}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2020a?}}).

\hypertarget{sec:challgnes_fcas_markets}{%
\paragraph{Challenges in frequency control services
markets}\label{sec:challgnes_fcas_markets}}

Frequency control services markets face both existing and emerging
challenges to achieving productive and dynamically efficient outcomes.
The main challenges being faced in these markets are outlined below:

\hypertarget{product-design-and-fungibility.}{%
\subparagraph{Product design and
fungibility.}\label{product-design-and-fungibility.}}

Products in existing frequency control services markets generally
reflect the capabilities and requirements of conventional frequency
control provided by synchronous generators
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-EU-SysFlex2019}{\textbf{EU-SysFlex2019?}}). As
frequency control abilities and needs have changed over time, various
jurisdictions have considered or created additional frequency control
services. These include ramping products, which have been implemented in
some ISO/RTO markets in response to increasing variability and
uncertainty (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2019}{\textbf{Ela2019?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2017}{\textbf{Ela2017?}}), FFR products to
mitigate RoCoF (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2019}{\textbf{Ela2019?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Fernandez-Munoz2020}{\textbf{Fernandez-Munoz2020?}})
and TFC or operating reserves where operating reserve margins are a
concern to the system operator
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-EnergySecurityBoard2020}{\textbf{EnergySecurityBoard2020?}}).

Furthermore, there are trade-offs associated with the separation and
\emph{fungibility} of both existing and new frequency control products.
Market-based mechanisms will work best when a particular frequency
control product is a fungible and well defined, or ``discrete'',
commodity supplied by various providers
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gimon2020}{\textbf{Gimon2020?}}). With a
sufficiently large market, prices should reflect the costs incurred by
various providers to provide such a service
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2012b}{\textbf{Ela2012b?}}). This, however,
ignores the wide ``spectrum'' of technical capabilities of power system
resources with respect to frequency control.

Understanding the trade-offs in creating fungible new products is
important to frequency control service market design. For example, while
a new product may value and incentivise the provision of a particular
frequency response
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2012b}{\textbf{Ela2012b?}}), a market may not
deliver a net benefit if there is limited competition or the costs and
complexity of administering a market are significant
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rebours2007b}{\textbf{Rebours2007b?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2019}{\textbf{Ela2019?}}).

\hypertarget{price-formation.}{%
\subparagraph{Price formation.}\label{price-formation.}}

Price formation is an unresolved issue within frequency control services
market design. Ideally, the price of provision should be explicit,
transparent and recognise the true value of the service alongside any
opportunity-costs incurred by the supplying participant. There are three
main issues that hamper efficient price formation and hence productive
and dynamically efficient market outcomes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Frequency control products are arbitrarily defined by a system
  operator and often procured in a single-sided market due to the
  \emph{public good} nature of frequency control
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Billimoria2020}{\textbf{Billimoria2020?}};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-Pollitt2019a}{\textbf{Pollitt2019a?}}). As
  such, the true value of these services to power system users is not
  recognised
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rebours2007b}{\textbf{Rebours2007b?}}).
\item
  Furthermore, in co-optimised markets, there is a tension between the
  relatively low opportunity costs of existing synchronous generation
  providing frequency control services and the strong price signals
  needed to incentivise new capabilities, particularly from high
  capital, low operating cost inverter-based resources
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2019}{\textbf{Ela2019?}}).
\item
  Some products, such as inertia, may be `lumpy' in their provision and
  inseparable from other system security products
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Billimoria2020}{\textbf{Billimoria2020?}};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-EnergySecurityBoard2020}{\textbf{EnergySecurityBoard2020?}}).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{cost-allocation.}{%
\subparagraph{Cost allocation.}\label{cost-allocation.}}

In many mandatory pool markets, the cost of frequency control services
procured by the system operator is allocated to loads, even though the
deviation of generation may cause the need for procurement in the first
place (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Milligan2011a}{\textbf{Milligan2011a?}}).
Australia's NEM has a `Causer Pays' cost allocation framework in place
for frequency control services procured for contingency response and
regulation, though the mechanism for the latter suffers from a lack of
transparency, complexity and fundamental design flaws
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Riesz2015b}{\textbf{Riesz2015b?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2020}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2020?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyRegulator2020}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyRegulator2020?}}).
Cost allocation could provide disincentives for undesirable behaviour,
such as deviation from SCED dispatch instruction, and create
counter-parties for hedging frequency control services price risk and
therefore assist in price formation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Thorncraft2007}{\textbf{Thorncraft2007?}}). As
the power system continues to transition, it may be possible to
allocated costs based on a `User Pays' framework, whereby power system
resources that impose frequency zenith, nadir or RoCoF limits pay for
frequency control services
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2020a}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2020a?}}).

\hypertarget{ibr-participation.}{%
\subparagraph{IBR participation.}\label{ibr-participation.}}

IBR cannot or do not participate in many frequency control services
markets. Historically, literature has focused on the impact of variable
IBR on frequency control-related integration costs and how these costs
can be minimised (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2011}{\textbf{Ela2011?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Riesz2015b}{\textbf{Riesz2015b?}}). However, for
reasons discussed in \protect\hyperlink{sec:ibr_freq}{5} and as
demonstrated by variable IBR frequency control trials
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AEMO2018d}{\textbf{AEMO2018d?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Loutan2017}{\textbf{Loutan2017?}}) and the
provision of frequency control services by BESS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2018i}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketOperator2018i?}}),
there is both a growing need for and benefit to IBR providing frequency
control services. In markets such as Australia's NEM, many IBR can
participate in frequency control services markets but choose not to as
their business models rely on revenue from energy provision and the
opportunity-cost of participation is too high
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AEMO2018d}{\textbf{AEMO2018d?}}). An active area
of interest is designing frequency control services markets and the
revenue earned within them to incentivise IBR participation and
investment in frequency control capabilities, particularly as system
security requirements change over time and as high instantaneous IBR
penetrations are often associated with low energy prices
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2019}{\textbf{Ela2019?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-EnergySecurityBoard2020}{\textbf{EnergySecurityBoard2020?}}).

\hypertarget{sec:regulatory_mech}{%
\paragraph{Regulatory mechanisms}\label{sec:regulatory_mech}}

Regulatory mechanisms, such as equipment technical standards, grid codes
and system operator intervention, were used by monopoly electric
utilities and system operators to procure sufficient frequency control
response prior to implementation of frequency control services markets.
Even now, regulatory mechanisms are used in conjunction with
market-based mechanisms to procure frequency control services. In fact,
the processes of designing and regulating market rules are in and of
themselves regulatory mechanisms
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Sioshansi2006}{\textbf{Sioshansi2006?}}).

\hypertarget{potential-benefits-of-regulatory-mechanisms}{%
\subparagraph{Potential benefits of regulatory
mechanisms}\label{potential-benefits-of-regulatory-mechanisms}}

Regulatory mechanisms are ideal for mandating basic frequency control
capabilities as a condition for access or where markets may be difficult
to design or suffer from major flaws such as a concentration of market
power, oversupply of a product or the issues discussed in
\protect\hyperlink{sec:challgnes_fcas_markets}{6.1.4}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2012b}{\textbf{Ela2012b?}}).

\hypertarget{shortfalls-of-regulatory-mechanisms}{%
\subparagraph{Shortfalls of regulatory
mechanisms}\label{shortfalls-of-regulatory-mechanisms}}

It may be difficult for regulatory mechanisms to ensure that sufficient
frequency control services can be procured in power systems and
electricity markets that are rapidly facing more power electronic-based
control systems, lower levels of operational inertial response and
higher variability and uncertainty of different scales and nature.
Prescriptive regulatory mechanisms, such as grid codes, are often only
updated after a number of years to reduce the compliance burden placed
on connecting generators and loads. As such, they are slow to respond to
changing frequency control capabilities and requirements. This delay can
make new standards and requirements reactive rather than proactive. For
example, AEMO can only review generator technical performance standards
every 5 years
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2018}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2018?}}),
a timeframe in which the solar PV capacity installed in the NEM has more
than tripled (2014-2019)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianPVInstitute}{\textbf{AustralianPVInstitute?}}).

\hypertarget{regulatory-requirements-as-a-solution-to-market-failures}{%
\subparagraph{Regulatory requirements as a solution to market
failures}\label{regulatory-requirements-as-a-solution-to-market-failures}}

Regulatory mechanisms are being increasingly used in power system
jurisdictions where frequency control services markets have failed to
incentivise or procure or appropriate capabilities and services, or
where there is significant uncertainty around frequency response from
generation. For example, several power systems, including the Australian
NEM, have mandated some degree of PFC provision from connected
generators in their grid codes or market rules
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2020}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2020?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Roberts2018}{\textbf{Roberts2018?}}). Similarly,
frequency response has also been specified as a requirement for new
generation (primarily IBR) to access and connect to the NEM and ISO/RTO
markets in the U.S.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2018}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2018?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-FederalEnergyRegulatoryCommissionFERC2018}{\textbf{FederalEnergyRegulatoryCommissionFERC2018?}}).

\hypertarget{role-of-regulatory-mechanisms}{%
\subsubsection{Role of regulatory
mechanisms}\label{role-of-regulatory-mechanisms}}

Though processes across several jurisdictions are underway to address
frequency control services market deficiencies (e.g.~the Australian
NEM's post-2025 market design project
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-EnergySecurityBoard2020}{\textbf{EnergySecurityBoard2020?}}),
the Electric Reliability Council of Texas' (ERCOT) Nodal Protocol
Revision Request (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2019}{\textbf{Ela2019?}})
and the EU-SysFlex project
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-EU-SysFlex2019}{\textbf{EU-SysFlex2019?}})),
there has been relatively little work around what role regulatory
mechanisms may play, how they interact with market-based mechanisms and
the relative benefits and costs of further frequency control services
marketisation, both now and into the future.

\hypertarget{sec:designing_arrangements}{%
\subsection{Designing frequency control
arrangements}\label{sec:designing_arrangements}}

Designing frequency control arrangements is a control, regulatory and
market design problem which has become more complex in recent years due
to electricity industry restructuring and growing penetrations of IBR
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-VanderVeen2016}{\textbf{VanderVeen2016?}}).

\hypertarget{outcomes-of-good-design}{%
\subsubsection{Outcomes of good design}\label{outcomes-of-good-design}}

It is important to define desired outcomes of the design process. Below,
we present three outcomes that have previously been proposed for
designing ancillary/system services arrangements (including frequency
control arrangements) by
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rebours2007b}{\textbf{Rebours2007b?}}) and the
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2020a}{\textbf{AustralianEnergyMarketCommission2020a?}}).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Effectiveness}. This entails both sufficient quantity and
  performance of procured frequency control services to ensure that
  power system security requirements are met.
\item
  \textbf{Efficiency}. Efficient frequency control arrangements will
  procure services at the lowest cost to the system, both now
  (productive efficiency) and into the future (dynamic efficiency).
  Furthermore, efficient arrangements should also procure the right mix
  of services according to user and/or system needs (\emph{allocative
  efficiency}).
\item
  \textbf{Minimising procurement costs and complexity}. Procurement and
  verification of delivery of frequency control services may involve
  significant costs associated with facilitation and monitoring. This
  could include metering equipment, IT systems and additional staffing
  costs. Complex procurement arrangements may also have unintended and
  unforeseen consequences on processes and markets that interface with
  these arrangements, such as the energy market and other ancillary
  services markets.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{complexity-of-the-design-process}{%
\subsubsection{Complexity of the design
process}\label{complexity-of-the-design-process}}

Designing frequency control arrangements is a complex exercise in
managing interrelated and interacting capabilities, mechanisms and
objectives (\protect\hyperlink{fig:design_complexity}{7}). The frequency
control \emph{capability} of a power system is distinct from its
\emph{performance}, with a \emph{control strategy} defining how the
former translates to the latter. The frequency control capability of a
power system is determined by the physical characteristics and
configuration of generators, loads and network elements within a
synchronous area.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:design_complexity}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{source/figures/capability_performance-04.png}
\caption{A diagrammatic depiction of the complexity involved in
designing power system frequency control
arrangements.}\label{fig:design_complexity}
}
\end{figure}

Frequency control services from capable resources are often mandated
through connection requirements or power system operator intervention
(see \protect\hyperlink{sec:regulatory_mech}{6.2}), incentivised through
remunerative schemes, or procured through a contract or spot market (see
\protect\hyperlink{sec:market_mech}{6.1})
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Billimoria2020}{\textbf{Billimoria2020?}}).
Together with the control specification of frequency control products,
these mechanisms define a power system \emph{control strategy} that
dictates how capable system resources respond to deviations, and
therefore determine the frequency control \emph{performance} of a power
system. The outcomes that define frequency control performance can be
divided into physical performance criteria, which describe the
effectiveness of frequency control services provided, and economic
objectives, which relate to the productive, dynamic and price and
cost-allocation efficiency of the arrangements.

\hypertarget{interactions-between-capability-strategy-and-performance}{%
\paragraph{Interactions between capability, strategy and
performance}\label{interactions-between-capability-strategy-and-performance}}

These three design layers often interact. Technical capabilities may
guide the design of the control strategy, and therefore the mechanisms
that define frequency control performance. An example of such a process
is the PJM Interconnection (an RTO) implementing a high frequency AGC
signal designed for BESS providing fast regulation frequency control
services (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Benner2015}{\textbf{Benner2015?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Brooks2019}{\textbf{Brooks2019?}}). Similarly,
deficiencies in performance can be addressed through modifying the
control strategy to procure additional or more suitable frequency
control capability. The California and Midcontinent ISOs have introduced
ramping products to address increasing variability and uncertainty in
their power systems (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2016}{\textbf{Ela2016?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2017}{\textbf{Ela2017?}}).

\hypertarget{diversity-of-design-outcomes}{%
\subsubsection{Diversity of design
outcomes}\label{diversity-of-design-outcomes}}

The design process has and will most likely continue to proceed
differently across jurisdictions due to the diversity of both the
technical capabilities of resources within power systems (see
\protect\hyperlink{sec:freq_dev_control}{4} and
\protect\hyperlink{sec:ibr_freq}{5}) and the different structures and
features of various electricity markets (see

\subsubsection{Design principles and
considerations}\label{design-principles-and-considerations}}

Previous literature has explored the key design considerations for
frequency control arrangements.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rebours2007b}{\textbf{Rebours2007b?}}) outline
design principles for power pool markets related to the frequency
control services procurement, price formation, cost-allocation and
market structure, which includes how frequency control services are
offered, remunerated and cleared in markets, in addition to market
operation and regulation.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-VanderVeen2016}{\textbf{VanderVeen2016?}}) build
upon the work of
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rebours2007b}{\textbf{Rebours2007b?}}) to
provides a more comprehensive treatment of frequency control arrangement
design variables and performance criteria. The key contribution of
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-VanderVeen2016}{\textbf{VanderVeen2016?}}) is
that they explore some of the trade-offs between performance criteria
when designing frequency control services markets. However, as they
focus on the design challenge in European bilateral markets, some of
these trade-offs are not relevant to or present in mandatory pool
markets.

Both (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rebours2007b}{\textbf{Rebours2007b?}}) and
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-VanderVeen2016}{\textbf{VanderVeen2016?}})
emphasise that good design will lead to efficient and effective
frequency control arrangements. However,
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-VanderVeen2016}{\textbf{VanderVeen2016?}})
focuses solely on market design whilst
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rebours2007b}{\textbf{Rebours2007b?}}) assesses
various competitive procurement options but only briefly discusses the
relative merits of compulsory provision of frequency control services
through regulatory mechanisms. The work from these authors concentrates
on achieving economic efficiency but pays relatively little attention to
the technical capabilities of power system resources and the design of
and interactions between frequency control products.

\hypertarget{holistic-design}{%
\paragraph{Holistic design}\label{holistic-design}}

(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2012b}{\textbf{Ela2012b?}}),
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Billimoria2020}{\textbf{Billimoria2020?}}) and
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-MacGill2020a}{\textbf{MacGill2020a?}}) recognise
that power system frequency control arrangements are typically composed
of a mixture of market-based mechanisms and regulatory mechanisms that
are compatible with the physics and control needs of the power system.
The challenge here is determining the appropriate combination of these
options for procurement, and the most suitable control mechanisms that
account for both frequency control capabilities and the physical
performance required by a power system. This can only be achieved by
considering the interactions, or \emph{interfaces}, between mechanisms
within a power system's frequency control strategy.

\hypertarget{interfaces}{%
\paragraph{Interfaces}\label{interfaces}}

The concept of interfaces in electricity industry decision-making is
distinct but coupled to the frequency control arrangement design layers
discussed above. Interfaces were first formalised by
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Thorncraft2007}{\textbf{Thorncraft2007?}}),
specifically with relation to the security decision-making interface
between commercial decision-making processes (i.e.~processes within
market-based mechanisms) and the technical and physical processes and
the requirements of the power system (i.e.~frequency control capability
and physical performance)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Thorncraft2009}{\textbf{Thorncraft2009?}}).

\hypertarget{security-decision-making-interface.}{%
\subparagraph{Security decision-making
interface.}\label{security-decision-making-interface.}}

The security decision-making interface includes system operator
processes in integrated markets (e.g.~SCUC and SCED) which co-optimise
the provision of energy and frequency control services
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chow2005}{\textbf{Chow2005?}}). Literature has
explored enhancing unit commitment and economic dispatch processes for
frequency control through frequency response constraints
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ela2014}{\textbf{Ela2014?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Doherty2005}{\textbf{Doherty2005?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Teng2015}{\textbf{Teng2015?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mancarella2017a}{\textbf{Mancarella2017a?}}) and,
more recently, inertia constraints
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gu2020}{\textbf{Gu2020?}};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Johnson2020}{\textbf{Johnson2020?}}). However,
these studies implicitly assume that existing security decision-making
processes and frequency control products are adequate and efficient, and
will therefore perform well.

\hypertarget{interfaces-between-mechanisms-in-the-frequency-control-strategy}{%
\subparagraph{Interfaces between mechanisms in the frequency control
strategy}\label{interfaces-between-mechanisms-in-the-frequency-control-strategy}}

Interfaces change over time and with technological innovation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Thorncraft2009}{\textbf{Thorncraft2009?}}). The
arrival of highly-controllable loads and IBR in the power system
warrants the consideration of a \emph{control system} process that is
separate from physical characteristics and processes
(\protect\hyperlink{fig:interfaces}{8}).

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{interface-between-control-and-procurement-mechanisms.}{%
\subparagraph{Interface between control and procurement
mechanisms.}\label{interface-between-control-and-procurement-mechanisms.}}

Some literature has begun to explore the interface between control
mechanisms and market-based mechanisms.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Garcia2019a}{\textbf{Garcia2019a?}}) explore the
impact of interchangeability between FFR and PFC on total system
frequency control services costs.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Badesa2020}{\textbf{Badesa2020?}}) outlined an
optimisation framework that enables inertia, a reduction in contingency
size and multi-speed PFC to be procured based on RoCoF and frequency
nadir constraints and, more significantly, priced with a view of
incentivising faster PFC and synthetic/virtual inertia provision from
IBR. However, these studies do not consider how control mechanisms might
interface with other regulatory mechanisms, such as equipment
performance standards.

\hypertarget{interface-between-procurement-mechanisms.}{%
\subparagraph{Interface between procurement
mechanisms.}\label{interface-between-procurement-mechanisms.}}

In framing the design challenge for power system security services in
the NEM, (\protect\hyperlink{ref-MacGill2020}{\textbf{MacGill2020?}}),
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Billimoria2020}{\textbf{Billimoria2020?}}) and
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Skinner2020}{\textbf{Skinner2020?}}) acknowledge
that there is a choice between, or potential combination of regulatory
mechanisms and market-based mechanisms for procurement, with the latter
two exploring the various advantages and disadvantages of each option.
In particular,
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Billimoria2020}{\textbf{Billimoria2020?}})
explores various procurement models and how regulatory and market-based
mechanisms may interact within them. However, these procurement models
are highly generic and further work is required to determine how
existing and emerging control mechanisms might be structured in each of
the models. Furthermore, there is a need to understand how these
procurement models might interface with and integrate into existing and
emerging market processes if an optimum for the entire system is to be
achieved (\protect\hyperlink{ref-MacGill2020}{\textbf{MacGill2020?}}).

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Frequency control is vital to the secure operation of a power system.
The inherent characteristics and control systems of IBR differ from
those of synchronous machines and this poses both opportunities and
challenges to frequency control arrangements in mandatory pool markets
with growing instantaneous penetrations of IBR. The frequency control
performance of a power system is highly influenced by the frequency
control strategy, which consists of the control mechanisms, electricity
market design and the regulatory mechanisms that are in place, and the
frequency control capability of its resources. Determining the
appropriate combination of these mechanisms will require examining the
interfaces between market-based, regulatory and control mechanisms and
identifying the benefits, costs and trade-offs associated with
particular design choices. This will enable electricity market designers
to make an informed choice in implementing effective and efficient
frequency control arrangements in low-carbon electricity markets.

\section{Abstract}\label{abstract-1}}

For restructured electricity industries undergoing energy transition,
designing effective and efficient frequency control arrangements is a
complex and ongoing task that requires appropriate configuration of
controllers, generator technical connection requirements, market
arrangements and wider policy settings. In this paper, we provide an
overview and assessment of these arrangements in Australia's National
Electricity Market - a useful case study given its long-standing
frequency control ancillary services markets, yet recent challenges in
maintaining secure frequency control. We assess the performance of these
evolving arrangements in delivering improved frequency control outcomes,
with particular regard to growing renewable penetrations and evident
tensions between mandatory requirements and market-based incentives.
Based on this assessment, we draw out four key insights on designing
frequency control arrangements as power system capabilities and needs
change: 1) Understanding control action interactions, 2) Implementing
efficient price formation and cost-allocation mechanisms, 3) Monitoring
and assessing service provision to better align participant remuneration
with service quality, and 4) Considering both regulatory and market
mechanisms and their consequences and interactions. In particular, we
discuss the trade-offs between effective and efficient outcomes, and
provide arguments for more robust and forward-looking frequency control
arrangements during energy transition.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:fcs-intro}}

As a consequence of growing momentum to address global warming and
continually declining technology costs, many power systems around the
world are undergoing an energy transition in which significant capacity
additions of variable renewable energy (VRE) and other inverter-based
resources (IBR) are being accompanied by the progressive retirement of
existing fossil fuel generation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-internationalenergyagencyNetZero20502021}{International
Energy Agency, 2021}). Such power systems are currently experiencing or
expected to soon experience high instantaneous penetrations of VRE
(i.e.~beyond 50\% of grid demand being met by VRE at any given time),
which can pose technical challenges to the stable and secure operation
of a power system
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kenyonStabilityControlPower2020}{Kenyon et al.,
2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-kroposkiAchieving100Renewable2017}{Kroposki et
al., 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021}{Meegahapola
et al., 2021}). While several of these challenges have technological
solutions of various maturities, configuring mechanisms in an effective
and efficient manner across power system design layers, which span from
how resources are controlled to how grid codes and markets are designed,
remains an open and significant challenge.

In this article, we focus on one aspect of power system security:
control of AC frequency. Maintaining frequency near the nominal value of
a power system (either 50 or 60 Hz) is contingent on the ongoing balance
of active power supply and demand within a synchronous area
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994}{Grainger,
1994}). Power system frequency deviations are a consequence of
instantaneous supply-demand imbalances, which typically occur as a
result of system variability (predictable changes in supply or demand,
such as fluctuations and ramps of generation or load) and uncertainty
(unpredicted changes in supply or demand, such as forecast errors or
unplanned outages)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaOperatingReservesVariable2011}{Ela et al.,
2011}). System operators (SOs) achieve short-term active power balancing
using reserve capacity. Whilst there are many names for these
reserves\footnote{The term \emph{balancing services} is used in European
  systems, whereas the term \emph{operating reserves} is widely used in
  North America.}, this article will focus on a common subset that
responds to and mitigates frequency deviations over short timeframes
(milliseconds to minutes). We will refer to such reserves as
\emph{Frequency Control Services} (FCS). If FCS are insufficient or
inadequate, the system frequency may deviate beyond acceptable system
limits and lead to equipment damage, load shedding, generator trips and
cascading failures that lead to blackouts
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kirbyFrequencyControlConcerns2002}{Kirby et al.,
2002}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-ulbigImpactLowRotational2014}{Ulbig et
al., 2014}).

In electricity industries with competitive markets for energy and FCS,
frequency control arrangements consist of control, regulatory and
market-based mechanisms
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021}{Mancarella and
Billimoria, 2021}). Control mechanisms specify the technical
requirements for FCS. Regulatory and market-based mechanisms are used by
the SO to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Mandate or incentivise participant behaviour in the energy market that
  facilitates system balancing. This includes enforcing dispatch
  compliance or penalising participant portfolio imbalances; and
\item
  Procure FCS from capable resources (i.e.~generators, loads and network
  elements).
\end{enumerate}

Regulatory FCS procurement mechanisms are often mandatory and include
equipment standards, connection requirements and SO intervention,
whereas market-based FCS procurement mechanisms are often voluntary and
include remunerative schemes and contract or spot markets. Together,
these mechanisms dictate the physical effectiveness and productive,
dynamic, price formation and cost-allocation efficiencies of FCS
provision and procurement. Well-designed arrangements should be
effective and efficient, where \emph{effectiveness} entails sufficient
and robust frequency response to meet physical power system requirements
and \emph{efficiency} relates to frequency response being provided at
low cost, both now and into the future
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007}{Y. Rebours
et al., 2007};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016}{van der
Veen and Hakvoort, 2016}).

As power systems transition towards higher instantaneous penetrations of
VRE and IBR, SOs are likely to face the following challenges to
short-term system balancing that may require existing frequency control
arrangements to be revisited:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  VRE adds variability and uncertainty to a power system, particularly
  if similar technologies are situated within close proximity of one
  another (i.e.~correlated production and/or forecast errors)
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020a};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-keeratimahatAnalysisShorttermOperational2021}{Keeratimahat
  et al., 2021}). Furthermore, unless an appropriate response is
  incorporated and enabled in their control systems, VRE and other IBR
  do not provide FCS. In jurisdictions that do not require, incentivise
  or allow VRE and IBR to provide FCS, the displacement of synchronous
  machines in dispatch has led to lower availabilities of resources that
  provide FCS
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020c}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020b};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-denholmInertiaPowerGrid2020}{Denholm et al.,
  2020};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-milanoFoundationsChallengesLowInertia2018}{Milano
  et al., 2018}) .
\item
  In jurisdictions with competitive markets for energy and FCS, there is
  a tension between achieving economically efficient markets and the
  redundancy, certainty and control afforded to the SO. While the
  societal and economic costs of power system failure are often very
  large, it may be difficult for the SO to justify the cost of
  mitigation measures when they are ongoing or significant and when the
  joint probability of events or failures is low. The uncertainties
  associated with energy transition and the impacts of global warming
  are likely to present additional challenges. Power system security
  measures may need to be implemented rapidly and be both robust to a
  range of futures and resilient in the face of shocks, such as severe
  weather events
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-egglestonSecurityResilienceTechnical2021}{Eggleston
  et al., 2021};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-prakashResponseFrequencyControl2021}{Prakash et
  al., 2021}).
\end{itemize}

In this paper, we provide insights and recommendations on designing more
effective and efficient frequency control arrangements based on
experience from the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The
NEM is currently experiencing relatively high system-wide instantaneous
VRE penetrations (just over 60\% in 2021) and is expected to experience
penetrations as high as 75-100\% by 2025
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorNEMEngineeringFramework2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021b},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorQuarterlyEnergyDynamics2021}{2021c}).
Though the NEM's frequency control arrangements were once arguably
world-leading
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015}{Riesz et
al., 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007}{Thorncraft
and Outhred, 2007}), the speed at which system capabilities and needs
are changing and the removal of mandatory requirements in 2001 as a part
of a paradigm shift from obligation to remuneration for FCS have exposed
design issues. In attempting to address these issues, the NEM's rule
makers have placed FCS obligations on generators and transmission
network operators and have undertaken reforms to the NEM's energy and
FCS markets, including introducing a new market to procure emergency
fast frequency response (FFR) from IBR. Whilst the NEM is an
electrically-isolated power system with a relatively simple energy-only
market, the insights and recommendations from this paper are likely to
be relevant to other power systems and interconnections as their
existing conventional generation retires and VRE deployment levels
increase.

This paper offers three contributions to the literature. First, we
provide a high-level overview and comparison of the key features of
frequency control arrangements in North America and Central and Western
Europe, and provide a review of the most prominent challenges to
designing effective and efficient frequency control arrangements and the
potential solutions discussed in the literature. Second, we provide a
comprehensive update to previous literature on frequency control in the
NEM (\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015}{Riesz et
al., 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorncraftMarketbasedAncillaryServices2008}{Thorncraft
et al., 2008};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007}{Thorncraft
and Outhred, 2007}). Our analysis benefits from recent experience in the
NEM that encompasses deteriorating frequency performance, the
reintroduction of mandatory requirements and integrating higher shares
of VRE. While several of these aspects have been discussed independently
in the literature, this paper seeks to provide a structured and holistic
analysis of developments in the NEM and their implications for frequency
control arrangement design. Third, this article advocates for designers
placing a greater emphasis on delivering forward-looking frequency
control arrangements during energy transition through the implementation
of more robust regulatory mechanisms and ensuring that market-based
mechanisms are capable of supporting FCS investment. As highlighted in
the following sections, these design features have received surprisingly
little attention in the literature.

The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. In
Section~\ref{sec:fcs-context}, we provide an overview of typical
frequency control arrangements, with a focus on restructured electricity
industries in North America and Europe, and the main challenges faced in
their design. We describe the NEM, its frequency control arrangements
and the specific challenges posed by increasing penetrations of VRE and
other IBR in Section~\ref{sec:fcs-nem}. In
Section~\ref{sec:fcs-insights}, we analyse the performance of the NEM's
frequency control arrangements in responding to the challenges explored
in Section~\ref{sec:fcs-context}, with primary frequency response and
regulation (secondary frequency response) services in the NEM as case
studies. Based on our analysis, we conclude by offering four key
insights to operators, regulators and market-bodies that include
understanding control action interactions; ensuring that arrangements
are capable of supporting investment in FCS capability; monitoring,
assessing and remunerating FCS performance; and considering both
regulatory and market-based mechanisms in the design of effective and
efficient frequency control arrangements.

\section{Context}\label{sec:fcs-context}}

\hypertarget{conventional-frequency-control-schemes}{%
\subsection{Conventional frequency control
schemes}\label{conventional-frequency-control-schemes}}

SOs employ hierarchical and sequential frequency control schemes. In
most power systems, such schemes implicitly include inertial response
and explicitly define FCS such as primary frequency response (PFR),
secondary frequency response (SFR) and tertiary frequency response
(TFR). In general, once frequency has deviated from the system nominal
value, synchronous machines provide an inertial response that is
inherent and immediate in slowing the rate of change of frequency
(RoCoF). Within seconds, generators and/or loads provide autonomous and
decentralised control action through PFR
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-etoFrequencyControlRequirements2018}{Eto et al.,
2018};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020}{Machowski et
al., 2020}). PFR arrests the frequency deviation to enable the slower
and more centralised control actions of SFR and TFR to return the power
system frequency to its nominal value
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaAlternativeApproachesIncentivizing2012}{Ela
et al., 2012b}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-etoUseFrequencyResponse2010}{Eto
et al., 2010}). Should system frequency continue to rise or fall beyond
the system's allowable limits, emergency protection schemes such as
under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) and over-frequency generation
shedding (OFGS) relays may be triggered. In some systems, RoCoF relays
are also used to prevent high RoCoFs from tripping or damaging equipment
and to contain frequency nadirs and zeniths
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-akramEnergyStorageShortTerm2020}{Akram et al.,
2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016}{DGA
Consulting, 2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-millerAdvisoryEquipmentLimits2017}{Miller et al.,
2017a}).

\hypertarget{procurement-of-frequency-control-services}{%
\subsection{Procurement of frequency control
services}\label{procurement-of-frequency-control-services}}

Except for inertial response from synchronous machines, the SO procures
FCS capacity from capable resources within its control area and, in the
case of SFR and TFR, activates FCS energy if necessary. In electricity
industries where the SO owns most if not all the generation assets
(i.e.~a vertically-integrated utility), the SO is able to jointly
schedule generation and FCS capacity with knowledge of the condition of
the system and the status and cost structures of their plant. However,
many electricity industries have undergone some degree of restructuring,
which has created a greater role for competitively-oriented
decentralised decision-making
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016}{van
der Veen and Hakvoort, 2016}) . The diverse outcomes of restructuring
processes and differences in technical characteristics
(e.g.~capabilities of resource mix and network topology) have led to a
wide range of frequency control arrangements across power systems
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019}{Poplavskaya
and de Vries, 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007}{Y. Rebours et
al., 2007}) , which have been reviewed and compared extensively within
industry and academic literature
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-banshwarInternationalExperienceTechnical2018}{Banshwar
et al., 2018};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-brooksReviewFrequencyRegulation2019}{Brooks and
Lesieutre, 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaAncillaryServicesUnited2019}{Ela and Hytowitz,
2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hewickerDimensioningControlReserves2020}{Hewicker
et al., 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lopezSurveyAssessmentTechnical2020}{Lopez et al.,

Consulting LLC, 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-zhouSurveyAncillaryServices2016}{Zhou et al.,
2016}).

In restructured electricity industries, the provision of more passive
FCS (e.g.~ride-through capabilities) is usually mandated by regulatory
mechanisms such as connection agreements and grid codes, whereas FCS
that require additional response capabilities or impose
opportunity-costs on suppliers are procured and remunerated by the SO
through market-based mechanisms. In Section~\ref{sec:fcs-NA} \&
Section~\ref{sec:fcs-EU}, we provide an overview of typical
features\footnote{We note that there are numerous differences between
  jurisdictional arrangements and terminology in each of these regions.
  For a more general overview of potential procurement models, refer to
  Billimoria et al.
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020}{2020}).} and
key developments in market-based mechanisms for procuring FCS in North
America and Central and Western Europe, respectively. These regions best
represent the two prevailing short-term wholesale electricity market
models: central dispatch markets, in which the SO issues dispatch
instructions, and decentralised or self-dispatch markets, in which
resource dispatch is managed by market participants
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-ahlqvistCentralSelfDispatchElectricity2018}{Ahlqvist
et al., 2018}). Given that FCS and energy are partially substitutable
goods, the characteristics of short-term wholesale electricity markets
heavily influence the design of FCS arrangements and thus these regions
provide an interesting contrast. However, despite their differences, the
SO plays a central role in both of these regions as they determine the
area demand for FCS capacity, activate FCS energy as required and are
ultimately responsible for ensuring that the power system is balanced
and securely operated.

\hypertarget{sec:fcs-NA}{%
\subsection{North American markets}\label{sec:fcs-NA}}

In North America, central dispatch wholesale electricity markets are
operated by an Independent System Operator (ISO) or Regional
Transmission Organization (RTO) and are distributed across three
synchronous areas. These markets consist of two short-term centralised
platforms: a day-ahead market and a real-time market. In the day-ahead
market, the SO solves a security-constrained unit commitment problem
using supply offers (single or three-part) and demand bids (quantity or
price-quantity) to produce day-ahead locational marginal prices and a
financially-binding hourly schedule. In the real-time market, the SO
solves a security-constrained economic dispatch problem (typically every
five minutes) using generator price-quantity offers and a demand
forecast to produce real-time locational marginal prices and a set of
physically and financially binding dispatch instructions. Thus, each
short-term market is cleared to maximise social welfare whilst
respecting network and system security constraints
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chowElectricityMarketDesign2005}{Chow et al.,
2005};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017}{Cramton,
2017}).

Except for Frequency Responsive Reserves (i.e.~PFR), operating reserves
(i.e.~FCS capacity) are explicitly procured by placing an obligation on
load-serving entities to self-provide or purchase their share from
SO-run FCS markets
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaAlternativeApproachesIncentivizing2012}{Ela
et al., 2012b};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-zhouSurveyAncillaryServices2016}{Zhou et al.,
2016}). These FCS markets are usually integrated into day-ahead market
and, in most jurisdictions, the real-time market. Standard products in
North American markets include Regulation (i.e.~SFR during normal
operation), Spinning and Non-Spinning Reserves (i.e.~TFR deployed
following an event)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaAncillaryServicesUnited2019}{Ela and
Hytowitz, 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hewickerDimensioningControlReserves2020}{Hewicker
et al., 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-zhouSurveyAncillaryServices2016}{Zhou et al.,
2016}). Participants can submit offers for FCS in addition to offer for
energy. Unit commitment and economic dispatch permit co-optimisation of
energy and FCS procurement. From the perspective of the SO,
co-optimisation ensures that the total system cost of achieving an
energy supply-demand balance is minimised alongside FCS requirements,
subject to network and system security constraints. From the perspective
of participants, co-optimisation leads to an FCS price that not only
reflects the price offer of the marginal resource, but also any "profit"
it forgoes in the energy market (assuming supplier offers reflect their
short-run marginal costs)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaEffectiveAncillaryServices2012}{Ela et al.,
2012a};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009}{Isemonger,
2009}). As such, ISO/RTO FCS markets can compensate opportunity-costs
related to the day-ahead and/or real-time market but only allocate costs
to load-serving entities through a procurement obligation.

Though North American FCS markets have predominantly procured and
remunerated FCS capacity, ISO/RTOs (except Texas' ISO, ERCOT) were
ordered to also remunerate Regulation providers for the quantity of
energy provided whilst accurately following control signals by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) Order 755
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-federalenergyregulatorycommissionfercOrderNo7552011}{Commission,
2011}). As such, Regulation providers offer a quantity of capacity, a
price for capacity and a price for "mileage", which is the energy
delivered. Remuneration for Regulation takes performance (the ability of
a resource to follow the ISO/RTO's control signals) into account, though
how this is implemented varies between ISO/RTOs
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaAncillaryServicesUnited2019}{Ela and
Hytowitz, 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-fernandez-munozFastFrequencyControl2020}{Fernández-Muñoz
et al., 2020}). A notable example is the PJM RTO, which uses both a
standard SFR control signal (RegA) and faster SFR control signal (RegD)
intended for battery energy storage systems (BESS). PJM determines how
interchangeable a resource's RegD provision is with RegA provision (the
marginal benefit factor) to clear the Regulation market and calculates a
performance score for use in market clearing and settlement. However,
according to the independent market monitor, the omission of the
marginal benefit factor from market settlement has led to perverse
market outcomes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-brooksReviewFrequencyRegulation2019}{Brooks and
Lesieutre, 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-monitoringanalytics2021QuarterlyState2021}{Monitoring
Analytics, 2021}).

\hypertarget{sec:fcs-EU}{%
\subsection{European markets}\label{sec:fcs-EU}}

Most of the electricity markets of Central and Western Europe are
self-dispatch and consist of two short-term platforms: the day-ahead
market and the intraday market, which can be continuous, composed of
frequently-run discrete auctions or a combination of the two. Each of
these platforms is coupled across the majority of market zones in
Europe, with a single price coupling algorithm used to simultaneously
clear zonal day-ahead markets and a single order book compiled to match
cross-zonal intraday orders
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-epexspotEuropeanMarketCoupling}{EPEX Spot,
n.d.}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-nemocommitteeSingleIntradayCoupling}{NEMO
Committee, n.d.}). In contrast to North American electricity markets,
the market operator is responsible for market operation and is distinct
from the Transmission System Operator (TSO). Generation and load are
managed by Balancing Responsible Parties (BRP), which must submit
binding operational schedules to the TSO ahead of delivery (often by the
day prior to delivery). As BRPs become aware of potential deviations
closer to real time (e.g.~improved forecasts), they are able to adjust
their submitted schedules (i.e.~remain "balanced") through trades on the
intraday market
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lagoMarketFrameworkGrid2021}{Lago et al., 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-musgensEconomicsDesignBalancing2014}{Müsgens et
al., 2014}). BRPs face financial repercussions if they are imbalanced
via an imbalance price and, in some jurisdictions, are legally obliged
to be balanced
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-entso-ewgasSurveyAncillaryServices2021}{ENTSO-E
WGAS, 2021}).

Following gate-closure of the intraday market, residual imbalances are
primarily addressed by FCS (known as balancing services) procured by the
TSO. Standard FCS in Europe include Frequency Containment Reserve
(i.e.~PFR), automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves (i.e.~SFR), and
manual Frequency Restoration Reserves and Replacement Reserves
(i.e.~both TFR), with minimum technical requirements for each specified
by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity
(ENTSO-E)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-europeannetworkoftransmissionsystemoperatorsforelectricityentso-eNetworkCodeLoadFrequency2013}{European
Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, 2013}).
Depending on the FCS product and the jurisdiction, TSOs may distinguish
between FCS capacity (balancing capacity) and the delivery of FCS energy
(balancing energy). The provision of one or both is mandated in some
cases, but where both are procured competitively, Balancing Service
Providers (BSP) typically submit separate offers for FCS capacity and
FCS energy
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-abbasyNationalDesignMultinational2012}{Abbasy,
2012}). FCS capacity markets are often cleared days to months in advance
of real-time whereas the FCS energy market, which effectively
constitutes merit-order or pro rata activation of capacity for FCS
energy provision, is cleared within an hour or minutes of real-time
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-entso-ewgasSurveyAncillaryServices2021}{ENTSO-E
WGAS, 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ockerDesignEuropeanBalancing2016}{Ocker et al.,
2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019}{Poplavskaya
and de Vries, 2019}). FCS capacity costs are typically allocated to
power system users via a grid tariff. FCS energy costs are typically
allocated to BRPs based on their schedule deviations and an imbalance
price, which may differ from the FCS energy price paid to BSPs
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015}{Hirth and
Ziegenhagen, 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vandezandeWellfunctioningBalancingMarkets2010}{Vandezande
et al., 2010}). As such, European FCS markets generally disincentivise
causers of imbalance through the imbalance price, which may also recover
or reflect the cost of FCS energy. However, since FCS capacity markets
are typically decoupled from and cleared ahead of short-term energy
markets, perceived opportunity-costs based on expected short-term energy
market prices must be internalised within participants' FCS offers.

Given the relatively high degree of interconnection between transmission
systems in Central and Western Europe, cross-TSO initiatives are in
place and being expanded to address imbalances and share FCS across the
Continental Europe synchronous area. When sufficient cross-TSO
transmission capacity is available, initiatives currently in place
enable participating TSOs to jointly procure Frequency Containment
Reserve capacity, net imbalances (i.e.~reduce the demand for SFR by
aggregating individual control area imbalances) and jointly procure
automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve capacity and energy
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-europeannetworkoftransmissionsystemoperatorsforelectricityentso-eENTSOEBalancingReport2020}{European
Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, 2020}).
Further efficiency gains are expected following the implementation of
integrated market platforms for imbalance netting and balancing energy
for SFR and TFR. The implementation of these platforms is mandated by
the European Commission's European Balancing Guideline and requires
certain FCS product definitions and market features to be harmonised
across the balancing energy markets of participating TSOs
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-50hzamprionapgeliartetennetConsultationDesignPlatform2017}{50hz,
2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-europeancommissionCommissionRegulationEU2017}{European
Commission, 2017}).

\hypertarget{designing-frequency-control-arrangements}{%
\section{Designing frequency control
arrangements}\label{designing-frequency-control-arrangements}}

As with any policy problem, designing frequency control arrangements in
restructured electricity industries requires design principles,
variables and performance criteria to be established. The public good
characteristics of frequency control have heavily influenced arrangement
design principles across jurisdictions, such as the common preference
for the SO to centrally coordinate FCS procurement and activation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-musgensEconomicsDesignBalancing2014}{Müsgens et
al., 2014};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007}{Y. Rebours et
al., 2007}). In contrast, though some design variables are common,
others may only apply to particular systems based on their resource mix,
network topology and/or market design. Y. Rebours et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007}{2007})
discuss design variables for central dispatch markets related to the
following arrangement features:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  FCS procurement;
\item
  Price formation, which when efficient should lead to FCS prices not
  only reflecting the true cost of the service, but also its true value
  to the system; and
\item
  Allocation of the cost of FCS.
\end{enumerate}

Similarly, Abbasy
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-abbasyNationalDesignMultinational2012}{2012})
discusses the main design variables applicable to European self-dispatch
markets. van der Veen and Hakvoort
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016}{2016})
build upon this work to provide a more comprehensive treatment of design
variables in self-dispatch markets. Y. Rebours et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007}{2007}),
Abbasy
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-abbasyNationalDesignMultinational2012}{2012})
and van der Veen and Hakvoort
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016}{2016})
all propose some variation of effectiveness and efficiency as
performance criteria, with van der Veen and Hakvoort
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016}{2016})
analysing the various trade-offs between and within each criterion.

Despite the well-defined nature of the design problem, there are several
challenges to achieving effective and efficient arrangements. In
Section~\ref{sec:fcs-ibr-challenges} \&
Section~\ref{sec:fcs-efficiency-challenges}, we present the most
prominent challenges and their treatment in the literature.

\hypertarget{sec:fcs-ibr-challenges}{%
\subsection{The influx of VRE and other IBR in power
systems}\label{sec:fcs-ibr-challenges}}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fcs-intro}, VRE adds variability and
uncertainty to power systems which, at the very least, can lead to
increased procurement and activation requirements for PFR and SFR during
normal operating conditions
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaOperatingReservesVariable2011}{Ela et al.,
2011}). Three proposals to address this issue and thus reduce FCS
requirements with growing penetrations of VRE have been discussed in the
literature. The first is to shorten energy market trading/dispatch
intervals (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ockerGermanParadoxBalancing2017}{Ocker
and Ehrhart, 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszDesigningElectricityMarkets2015}{Riesz and
Milligan, 2015}) and the time between market gate closure and dispatch
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-katzOpeningMarketsDesigning2019}{Katz et al.,
2019}), thereby enabling scheduling based on up-to-date system
conditions and forecasts. The second is to increase coordination between
control areas within a synchronous area by netting imbalances
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kingFlexibilityReserveReductions2011}{King et
al., 2011}), jointly procuring and dispatching FCS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-schererIntegratedPanEuropeanAncillary2013}{Scherer
et al., 2013}) or aggregating them into a single market region
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-milliganMarketCharacteristicsEfficient2010}{Milligan
and Kirby, 2010};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszDesigningElectricityMarkets2015}{Riesz and
Milligan, 2015}). These two proposals alone have delivered significant
system savings in Germany despite growing penetrations of VRE
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015}{Hirth and
Ziegenhagen, 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ockerGermanParadoxBalancing2017}{Ocker and
Ehrhart, 2017}). The third is for the SO to determine the required
quantity of FCS capacity (\emph{dimensioning}) using dynamic and
probabilistic approaches (as opposed to static and deterministic) that
adequately reflect current or expected power system conditions and an
acceptable level of risk, such as a reliability standard
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-devosDynamicDimensioningApproach2019}{De Vos et
al., 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-holttinenMethodologiesDetermineOperating2013}{Holttinen
et al., 2013};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ortega-vazquezRiskBasedReserveProcurement2020}{Ortega-Vazquez
et al., 2020}).

In recent years, SOs have become increasingly concerned with growing
penetrations of asynchronous IBR leading to higher RoCoFs and fewer
resources offering conventional FCS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-denholmInertiaPowerGrid2020}{Denholm et al.,
2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016}{DGA
Consulting, 2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hartmannEffectsDecreasingSynchronous2019}{Hartmann
et al., 2019}). However, VRE and other IBR are able to provide tunable
conventional FCS, FFR and/or an inherent response that strongly
resembles the inertial response of synchronous machines\footnote{The
  terms \emph{virtual, emulated and synthetic} inertia have been used in
  the literature to refer to a proportional active power response to
  RoCoF. However, these terms do not distinguish whether the inverter
  control scheme provides an inherent response (i.e.~from inverters
  operated as a voltage source which are commonly referred to as
  \emph{grid-forming inverters}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-cherevatskiyGridFormingEnergy2020}{Cherevatskiy
  et al., 2020};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-linResearchRoadmapGridForming2020}{Lin et al.,
  2020})) or a controlled response following frequency measurement
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-erikssonSyntheticInertiaFast2018}{Eriksson et
  al., 2018};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-tielensRelevanceInertiaPower2016}{Tielens and
  Van Hertem, 2016}).} if this is facilitated by arrangement design
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-fernandez-munozFastFrequencyControl2020}{Fernández-Muñoz
et al., 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021}{Mancarella and
Billimoria, 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-millerTechnologyCapabilitiesFast2017}{Miller et
al., 2017b}). Following a contingency event in a low-inertia power
system, rapid FCS from IBR can mitigate higher RoCoFs, which when
unabated can lead to deeper frequency nadirs and zeniths and the
subsequent activation of UFLS or OFGS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFastFrequencyResponse2017}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2017a};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-nercinverter-basedresourceperformancetaskforceFastFrequencyResponse2020}{NERC
Inverter-Based Resource Performance Task Force, 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-tielensRelevanceInertiaPower2016}{Tielens and Van
Hertem, 2016}).

\hypertarget{sec:fcs-efficiency-challenges}{%
\subsection{Achieving economic
efficiency}\label{sec:fcs-efficiency-challenges}}

Achieving short-run efficiency entails supplier costs being reflected in
their offers and adequately propagated to FCS prices, and the SO
assigning at least some portion of FCS costs to system users that create
a need for procurement or activation. A widely used pricing approach in
ISO/RTO co-optimised FCS markets is a marginal price which incorporates
the marginal resource's short-term market opportunity-costs and their
offer, which could reflect potential mileage or wear-and-tear costs
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-frewImpactOperatingReserve2021}{Frew et al.,
2021a}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-zhouSurveyAncillaryServices2016}{Zhou et
al., 2016}). Though improving cost-allocation has been repeatedly
proposed in North American literature
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaEffectiveAncillaryServices2012}{Ela et al.,
2012a};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009}{Isemonger, 2009};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-milliganIntegrationVariableGeneration2011}{Milligan
et al., 2011}), FCS costs are predominantly socialised across loads
based on demand or consumption. In Europe, however, much attention has
been given to FCS market pricing, scoring (the order in which offers are
selected) and cost-allocation. Specifically, literature on European FCS
markets has explored whether pay-as-bid or uniform pricing better
facilitates suppliers revealing their true costs
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015}{Hirth and
Ziegenhagen, 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-musgensEconomicsDesignBalancing2014}{Müsgens et
al., 2014};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ockerHarmonizationEuropeanBalancing2018}{Ocker et
al., 2018}), the particular offers scoring should consider
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-ehrhartDesignRegulationBalancing2021}{Ehrhart
and Ocker, 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-musgensEconomicsDesignBalancing2014}{Müsgens et
al., 2014}) and the design of imbalance prices to sufficiently
incentivise short-term balancing
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015}{Hirth and
Ziegenhagen, 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-papavasiliouScarcityPricingMissing2020}{Papavasiliou,
2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-vandezandeWellfunctioningBalancingMarkets2010}{Vandezande
et al., 2010}). Regardless, both European and North American literature
suggest that increased competition in FCS markets is a priority. This
could be facilitated by enabling distributed and utility-scale VRE and
IBR to qualify for FCS provision, reducing minimum offer quantities,
separating raise and lower (positive and negative) products and
increasing market clearing frequency and the time resolution of FCS
products (\protect\hyperlink{ref-frewImpactOperatingReserve2021}{Frew et
al., 2021a};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015}{Hirth and
Ziegenhagen, 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lagoMarketFrameworkGrid2021}{Lago et al., 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019}{Poplavskaya
and de Vries, 2019}). Despite the typically "shallow" nature of FCS
markets (i.e.~additional supply can significantly reduce prices
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszDesigningElectricityMarkets2015}{Riesz and
Milligan, 2015})), dynamic efficiency has received considerably less
attention. Notable exceptions include Papavasiliou
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-papavasiliouScarcityPricingMissing2020}{2020})
and Frew et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-frewImpactOperatingReserve2021}{2021a}), who
briefly discuss the potential for FCS scarcity pricing to better reflect
the true value of system reliability and support investment in FCS.

An additional challenge in implementing efficient FCS markets involves
the trade-offs that must be considered. As outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:fcs-intro}, some mechanisms that improve efficiency may
come at the expense of visibility, control and redundancy afforded to
the SO, which typically does not own any FCS-capable assets. The former
is typically achieved using market-based mechanisms and the latter
through regulatory mechanisms. Ela et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaAlternativeApproachesIncentivizing2012}{2012b}),
Billimoria et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020}{2020}),
Mancarella and Billimoria
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021}{2021}) and Lal
et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lalEssentialSystemServices2021}{2021})
discuss several prerequisites for implementing market-based mechanisms
and stress that balance between market-based and regulatory mechanisms
may be required. However, achieving this balance can be challenging due
to the asymmetry between the risk of an event and its consequences, and
that between the benefits of market efficiency and the cost of resilient
and robust mitigation measures
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lalEssentialSystemServices2021}{Lal et al.,
2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021}{Mancarella and
Billimoria, 2021}). Another trade-off is the arbitrary definition of FCS
products. Market-based mechanisms will work best when FCS are "discrete"
commodities and fungible. However, this ignores the wide ``spectrum'' of
resource technical capabilities. Favouring fungibility may obscure
physical and control interdependencies between FCS and restrict or fail
to incentivise higher quality provision, thereby leading to an
inefficient overall outcome
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gimonGridPhysicsMarkets2020}{Gimon, 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020}{MacGill and
Esplin, 2020}).

\section{Frequency control arrangements in the Australian National
Electricity Market}\label{sec:fcs-nem}}

\hypertarget{overview-of-the-nem}{%
\subsection{Overview of the NEM}\label{overview-of-the-nem}}

The NEM consists of five regions corresponding to the eastern and
southern Australian states of New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD),
Victoria (VIC), South Australia (SA) and Tasmania (TAS)
(Figure~\ref{fig:NEM}). In 2020, the NEM serviced a total electricity
consumption of approximately 190 TWh/year and a peak demand of
approximately 35 GW across a `stringy' network over 5000 kilometres long
with relatively weak interconnection between regions through
interconnectors
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2021}{Australian
Energy Regulator, 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020}{MacGill and
Esplin, 2020}). As high voltage DC transmission connects the island of
Tasmania to the mainland state of Victoria, the NEM consists of two
synchronous areas operated at a nominal frequency of 50 Hz: the mainland
states and Tasmania. Due to the large distances involved, the NEM is not
electrically connected to other markets.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:NEM}{%

transmission in the NEM. Source: Australian Energy Market Commission
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionNationalElectricityMarket}{n.d.a})}\label{fig:NEM}
}
\end{figure}

The NEM is a single platform (real-time) energy-only market with no
explicit capacity mechanisms. Unit commitment is managed by market
participants, who must submit resource-specific offers for energy and
Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) capacity in price-quantity
pairs the day before delivery. These offers are subsequently used in a
pre-dispatch process, which provides forecasted market information
(e.g.~generation and demand, interconnector flows, prices, etc.) to
market participants. While prices in submitted offers are fixed,
participants may change the energy volumes in their offer up to a few
minutes before the delivery dispatch interval commences. As the NEM is
single-sided, security-constrained economic dispatch is run every five
minute to meet forecast demand at least cost, subject to network and
security constraints. Much like ISO/RTO markets, energy and FCAS markets
are co-optimised with respect to technical feasibility and cost
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorDispatchStandardOperating2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021d},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFCASModelNEMDE2017}{2017b}).
Real-time dispatch produces zonal marginal prices for energy and FCAS,
which form the basis for market settlement in each of the NEM's regions.

\hypertarget{fcas-markets}{%
\subsection{FCAS markets}\label{fcas-markets}}

The NEM's competitive FCAS markets consist of eight separate raise and
lower FCAS products that can be classed as regulation FCAS or
contingency FCAS, with the former responsible for control when frequency
is within the normal operating frequency band (NOFB) and the latter for
when frequency deviates outside the NOFB after an event (see
Table~\ref{tbl:fcs-fcas}). This is similar to arrangements in many
ISO/RTO markets, where FCS are divided into event and non-event reserves
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaOperatingReservesVariable2011}{Ela et al.,
2011}).

Security-constrained economic dispatch includes system-wide and regional
FCAS requirement constraints. Regulation and contingency FCAS are
typically procured for and from all regions of the NEM in the absence of
binding local constraints. Local requirements for FCAS procurement apply
to Tasmania and to the other regions of the NEM if they experience
network constraints, are at risk of separation or when
islanded\footnote{From 2015-2019, the Tasmanian and mainland contingency
  FCAS markets were separated on average for 40\% of the time due to the
  technical limitations of the high voltage DC interconnector
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ghdadvisoryGHDReportTasNetworks2019}{GHD
  Advisory, 2019}). However, if the interconnector flow is within the
  appropriate operating envelope, NEM-wide FCAS procurement is possible
  as the interconnector's frequency controller enables FCAS transfer
  between the mainland and Tasmania
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorInterconnectorCapabilitiesNational2017}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2017c}).}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorConstraintImplementationGuidelines2015}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2015a},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorConstraintFormulationGuidelines2010}{2010}).
Prices are calculated for each region of the NEM based on the sum of the
shadow prices of local and system-wide constraints and FCAS costs are
allocated to market participants based on a "Causer Pays" principle,
which bears similarities to imbalance penalties in European markets
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorGuideAncillaryServices2015}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2015b}). FCAS providers are paid for enablement
(capacity provision) regardless of whether their capacity is activated
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorGuideAncillaryServices2015}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2015b};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015}{Riesz et al.,
2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007}{Thorncraft
and Outhred, 2007}).

For a resource to provide FCAS, it must meet pre-qualification criteria
and undergo a registration process. Historically, FCAS was provided by
thermal generation (predominantly coal and some gas), hydropower
generation and some large loads, such as hydropower pumps and an
aluminium smelter, as only resources associated with wholesale energy
market participants were permitted to offer FCAS. In 2017, the first
battery energy storage system (BESS) in the NEM began to offer FCAS and
market reform enabled demand response (DR) aggregators to offer
contingency FCAS without participating in the energy market
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-aureconLargeScaleBatteryStorage2019}{Aurecon,
2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionNationalElectricityAmendment2016}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2016}). In recent years, new FCAS market
entrants have included several DR aggregators, new BESS, distributed
PV-battery virtual power plants and wind farms (the latter two through
trials)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-aureconLargeScaleBatteryStorage2019}{Aurecon,
2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorAEMOVirtualPower2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021e};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2021}{Australian
Energy Regulator, 2021}). However, these new entrants tend to offer
smaller volumes and there are still relatively few FCAS providers in the
NEM, with no single FCAS product having more than 30 providers across
the system or 8 providers in any one region
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2021}{Australian
Energy Regulator, 2021}).

\subsection{NEM operation and
governance}\label{nem-operation-and-governance}}

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is responsible for the
operation of the market and power system in the NEM in accordance with
the National Electricity Rules (NER). They act as a single buyer of
dynamically-determined volumes of FCS. The Australian Energy Market
Commission (AEMC) is responsible for making or amending rules for the
NEM. Both AEMO and the AEMC provide operational and strategic advice to
the Energy Security Board (ESB), which is responsible for coordinating
market oversight and longer-term reform such as the ongoing post-2025
NEM market design framework. As the market regulator, the Australian
Energy Regulator (AER) monitors compliance with and enforces the NER.

\hypertarget{challenges-to-frequency-control-posed-by-vre-and-ibr}{%
\subsection{Challenges to frequency control posed by VRE and
IBR}\label{challenges-to-frequency-control-posed-by-vre-and-ibr}}

The rapid pace at which IBR have entered the NEM was preceded by the
exit of FCAS-capable synchronous generation
(Figure~\ref{fig:entry_exit}). Many of these IBR do not currently offer
FCAS or any meaningful frequency response to deviations other than the
most extreme. Furthermore, though updated equipment standards require
distributed IBR to ride-through and/or respond to certain frequency
deviations, some inverter models have been found to be non-compliant and
there is still a significant number of legacy systems in the NEM
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorBehaviourDistributedResources2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021f};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-stringerConsumerLedTransitionAustralia2020}{Stringer

}
\end{figure}

The challenges that VRE and other IBR pose to frequency control have
been exacerbated by the NEM's network topology. Limited interconnection
between regions reduces the NEM's cross-regional balancing capabilities
and increases the likelihood of synchronous area separation following
power system events, a consequence of which is that local requirements
for FCAS may apply
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorMaintainingPowerSystem2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019a}). Furthermore, correlated variability and
uncertainty can arise from intensive development of similar
utility-scale VRE in areas with good wind or solar resources (as might
occur in the Renewable Energy Zones identified by AEMO's least-regrets
transmission planning study
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020IntegratedSystem2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020d})). This is also an issue at the
distribution level given the significant installed capacities of rooftop
solar PV located within proximity of one another in suburban areas
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021a}).

\hypertarget{features-of-nem-frequency-control-arrangements}{%
\subsection{Features of NEM frequency control
arrangements}\label{features-of-nem-frequency-control-arrangements}}

Below, we highlight some noteworthy features of the NEM's frequency
control arrangements that complement or contrast previous analyses in
Thorncraft and Outhred
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007}{2007}),
Riesz et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015}{2015}) and
Thorncraft et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorncraftMarketbasedAncillaryServices2008}{2008}).

\hypertarget{control-mechanisms}{%
\subsubsection{Control mechanisms:}\label{control-mechanisms}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There is no explicit TFR FCS in the NEM. Security-constrained economic
  dispatch is run every five minutes and is expected to relieve PFR and
  SFR and address supply-demand imbalances
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPowerSystemRequirements2020}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020c}).
\item
  PFR from contingency FCAS is only required to respond to frequency
  deviations outside the NOFB (50 \(\pm\) 0.15 Hz). When FCAS markets
  were implemented in the NEM in 2001, mandatory PFR around a tight
  deadband of \(\pm\) 50 mHz was removed from the NER
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2019b}). Since then and prior to 2020, there
  was no explicit procurement or requirement for tight-deadband PFR
  provision within the NOFB. The decline in the provision of
  tight-deadband PFR in the NEM is discussed further in
  Section~\ref{sec:fcs-pfr}.
\item
  The mainland synchronous area is controlled as one balancing area by
  AEMO's AGC (i.e.~no tie-line biased SFR) despite limited
  interconnection between adjacent regions
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorAEMCFrequencyControl2018}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2018a}). AGC control performance is discussed
  further in Section~\ref{sec:fcs-regulation}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{market-based-mechanisms}{%
\subsubsection{Market-based mechanisms:}\label{market-based-mechanisms}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are relatively few limits imposed on FCAS participation. FCAS
  can be provided by any technology through variable, switched or hybrid
  controllers
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorMarketAncillaryService2020a}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020e}). Furthermore, regulation and
  contingency FCAS products are unbundled into raise and lower services,
  and contingency FCAS products are unbundled based on response time.
  All of these features improve the potential for participation and
  competition in FCAS markets, though market participants can and often
  are enabled to provide multiple FCAS.
\item
  FCAS unbundling has enabled a `Causer Pays' cost allocation framework.
  Raise contingency FCAS costs, which are incurred as insurance for the
  failure of a generator, are distributed amongst generators in
  proportion to their generation in the trading interval. Similarly,
  lower contingency FCAS costs are distributed amongst loads based on
  their consumption in a trading interval. A complex methodology is used
  to calculate monthly, portfolio-wide Causer Pays contribution factors
  (outlined in Australian Energy Market Operator
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRegulationFCASContribution2018a}{2018b})
  and summarised in Riesz et al.
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015}{2015}))
  that determine how regulation FCAS costs are allocated to market
  participants. We discuss the issues associated with this methodology
  in Section~\ref{sec:fcs-regulation}.
\item
  The NEM co-optimises FCAS that respond within similar timeframes. In
  the absence of constraints, the volume of 5-minute delayed contingency
  FCAS procured is reduced by the volume of regulation FCAS enabled
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorConstraintFormulationGuidelines2010}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2010}).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{regulatory-mechanisms}{%
\subsubsection{Regulatory mechanisms:}\label{regulatory-mechanisms}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Connecting utility-scale generators negotiate the frequency response
  capability of their plant between a minimum access standard and an
  automatic access standard, the latter guaranteeing network access to
  the applicant. A suite of generator standards for frequency response
  were added to the NER in October 2018 and apply to any
  newly-connecting generation. These standards include minimum frequency
  disturbance ride-through times, automatic generation output reduction
  following extreme over-frequency events and the capability to operate
  in a frequency response mode with a proportional response\footnote{In
    addition to these standards, newly-connected generation may install
    a synchronous condenser under the `do no harm' requirements outlined
    in the NER if they are determined to have an adverse impact on
    system strength. Particularly when fitted with a rotating mass or
    flywheel, these synchronous condensers can also provide inertial
    response
    (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSystemStrengthNEM2020}{Australian
    Energy Market Operator, 2020f}).}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionGeneratorTechnicalPerformance2018}{Australian
  Energy Market Commission, 2018a}).
\item
  Transmission Network Service Providers (TNSPs) are required to address
  any inertia shortfalls identified by AEMO within the NEM region in
  which they build, maintain, plan and operate the transmission network.
  AEMO's assessment considers whether an islanded region can be securely
  operated following a contingency event. Shortfalls can be reduced by
  special protection schemes (e.g.~disconnection of load following
  interconnector trip) and the provision of FFR, but they must
  ultimately be met by providers of inertial response
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorNoticeSouthAustralia2020}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020g},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorInertiaRequirementsMethodology2018}{2018c}).

\section{Insights from the National Electricity
Market}\label{sec:fcs-insights}}

In light of existing challenges and those posed by energy transition,
effective and efficient frequency control arrangements should enable
sufficient FCS to be procured across timeframes and strike the
appropriate balance between efficiency and robustness. In the following
sections, we review issues associated with two core elements of the
NEM's frequency control hierarchy (i.e.~PFR and SFR), assess their
physical and economic performance and outline reform underway. Drawing
on developments in the NEM and our review of arrangements in North
America and Europe, we then discuss the merits and flaws of regulatory
and market-based mechanisms with respect to sufficiency and efficiency.
We conclude by offering insights that could serve as design principles
for jurisdictions revisiting their frequency control arrangements during
energy transition.

\hypertarget{sec:fcs-pfr}{%
\section{Declining tight-deadband primary frequency
response}\label{sec:fcs-pfr}}

When FCAS markets were implemented in 2001, mandatory tight-deadband PFR
was superseded by two types of PFR: voluntary PFR within the NOFB and
competitive procurement for PFR outside the NOFB in the form of
contingency FCAS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019b}).

As such, the NEM's frequency control scheme deviated from what has been
argued to be international best practice as it only explicitly specified
and procured wide-deadband PFR (i.e.~deadband of \(\pm\) 150 mHz)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019b}). In contrast, ENTSO-E specifies that PFR
providers have a deadband no greater than \(\pm\) 10-15 mHz depending on
the control area
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-europeannetworkoftransmissionsystemoperatorsforelectricityentso-eNetworkCodeLoadFrequency2013}{European
Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, 2013}) and
FERC Order 842 mandates all newly-connecting generation in US
interconnections to operate frequency-responsive control equipment with
maximum deadbands of \(\pm\) 36 mHz
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-federalenergyregulatorycommissionfercOrderNo8422018}{Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 2018}).

In recent years in the NEM, the lack of an incentive or requirement for
tight-deadband PFR and perceived disincentives to its provision (through
Causer Pays contribution factors discussed further in
Section~\ref{sec:fcs-regulation}) has led to many synchronous generators
that once provided tight-deadband PFR to widen deadbands or install
control systems that block or dampen PFR from the speed governor within
the NOFB
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2020}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2020b}). Furthermore, many VRE generators were
deployed in the NEM and connected with inverter control systems that
were unresponsive to any frequency deviations other than the most
serious.

The extent to which tight-deadband PFR provision had declined in the NEM
and the consequences of this became clear to AEMO following a major
power system incident on the 25\textsuperscript{th} of August 2018
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFinalReportQueensland2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019c}). Prior to the event, the QLD region was
exporting \(\sim\) 900 MW to the rest of the NEM. Around 13:11:41,
lightning strikes at the QLD-NSW interconnector resulted in the QLD
region being separated from the rest of the NEM with excess supply. The
SA region was exporting \(\sim\) 200 MW prior to the event and following
QLD's separation, this increased by more than 200 MW in response to
under-frequency. The sudden increase in active power flow triggered an
emergency scheme that disconnected SA from the NSW-VIC synchronous area,
resulting in local over-frequency.

There were diverse responses from various generators following the
double separation event. While many synchronous generators provided some
form of PFR though not enabled for FCAS, their response was withdrawn by
their load controllers in several cases so that the unit could return to
its dispatch target (e.g.~green and pink lines in top frame of
Figure~\ref{fig:plant_responses}). Wind and solar farms were either
unresponsive, tripped due to protection settings in their inverters, or
reduced their active power output in line with performance standards
negotiated in their connection agreements (middle and bottom frames in
Figure~\ref{fig:plant_responses}). AEMO attributed slow frequency
recovery and under-frequency load shedding in NSW and VIC to
insufficient PFR from generators and a lack of appropriate contingency
FCAS within the islanded regions. Over 50\% of fast and slow raise
contingency FCAS needed in NSW-VIC was enabled in SA and QLD, whilst QLD
had no lower FCAS enabled to respond to over-frequency\footnote{AEMO is
  currently investigating appropriate regional requirements for FCAS,
  particularly for contingency FCAS in the terminal regions of QLD and
  SA
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020b}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020h},

}
\end{figure}

Prior to this incident, deteriorating control of frequency within the
NOFB was of concern to AEMO and the AEMC, and trials and investigations
were recommended to inform the design of an incentive for tight-deadband
PFR provision
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2018b}). However, this separation event
demonstrated the ``urgent need for regulatory changes to arrest the
ongoing decline in frequency performance in the NEM'' and to enhance
``the resilience of the NEM to similar major disturbances'', with AEMO
submitting a rule change proposal for all capable generators in the NEM
to provide mandatory PFR with a maximum deadband of \(\pm\) 0.015 Hz
(i.e.~10\% of the NOFB)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019b}).

This rule was initially incorporated into the NER in 2020 as a temporary
arrangement through the addition of a ``sunset'' after three years to
demonstrate the AEMC's commitment to investigating incentives or
market-based mechanisms for tight-deadband PFR
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2020}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2020b},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlRule2020}{2020c}).
AEMO has specified PFR settings, including maximum droop and response
time, but is unable to require generation to reserve headroom for PFR
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorInterimPrimaryFrequency2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020i}).

\hypertarget{sec:fcs-regulation}{%
\section{Performance and efficiency issues of regulation
services}\label{sec:fcs-regulation}}

For SFR provided by regulation FCAS within the NOFB to be effective, the
dynamics of the system need to accommodate slower SFR control action and
the centralised secondary controller (in the NEM, AEMO's AGC) needs to
be properly configured. Prior to the introduction of mandatory PFR in
the NEM, AEMO observed no significant improvement in NOFB frequency
stability despite several increases in the minimum volumes procured for
regulation FCAS in 2019
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019b}). This is likely due to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A lack of fast and decentralised tight-deadband PFR supporting slower
  SFR;
\item
  Inappropriate control signals being calculated within the AGC due to
  the use of rate limiters to account for ramping constraints, signal
  filtering and generator controller models that do not accurately
  reflect a unit's frequency response
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-digsilentReviewFrequencyControl2017}{DIgSILENT,
  2017}). The latter is the consequence of an absence of control
  coordination between market participants and AEMO; and
\item
  Variable communication delays between individual unit controllers and
  AEMO's AGC system, and disparate response times from generators.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, the control of all mainland regions as one balancing area
can be problematic in the event of separation. AGC control of regulation
FCAS enabled in islanded regions may exacerbate local frequency
deviations when responding to the AGC frequency reference. This was the
case during the double separation event on the 25\textsuperscript{th} of
August 2018, in which the AGC instructed raise regulation FCAS
generators in QLD and SA to respond to under-frequency in the AGC
frequency reference despite local over-frequency
(Figure~\ref{fig:regional_freq}). Such incorrect control action can
occur until AEMO is able to manually reconfigure the AGC to treat each
island as a control area - a process which can take up to 15 minutes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFinalReportQueensland2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019c}) .

2018. Note that the AGC reference frequency deviates in the opposite
direction to local frequency in QLD and SA.}\label{fig:regional_freq}
}
\end{figure}

Over time, inefficiencies in regulation FCAS procurement and
cost-allocation have also become apparent. Regulation FCAS procurement
in the NEM is dynamic beyond a minimum volume, but the dynamic component
is based on the system time error
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorConstraintImplementationGuidelines2015}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2015a}). Time error control is largely
unnecessary as modern clocks no longer rely on power system frequency to
keep the time
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007}{Y. Rebours
et al., 2007}). Furthermore, whilst AEMO is required to control the NEM
within certain time error limits, these have been relaxed in recent
years
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionreliabilitypanelStageOneFinal2017}{Australian
Energy Market Commission Reliability Panel, 2017}). Given that time
error is no longer prioritised as a control objective, dynamic
regulation FCAS procurement based on better measures of sustained
frequency deviation (e.g.~mean absolute error as suggested by Riesz et
al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015}{2015}))
and/or a modelled distribution of potential intra-dispatch ramp
uncertainty may be more suitable.

Regulation FCAS costs are allocated to market participants based on
their contribution factor, a calculation which represents the extent to
which the participant has contributed to the need for regulation FCAS
through a deviation from a dispatch trajectory. Though the calculation
methodology assigns weights to a generator or load's dispatch trajectory
deviation based on the AGC regulation direction and mileage requirement
every 4 seconds, the disincentive for dispatch deviation suffers from a
disconnect to causation. This is because the contribution factors of a
generator or load are averaged over a 5-minute dispatch interval, summed
over a 28-day period and then within a market participant's portfolio
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2018b};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRegulationFCASContribution2018a}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2018b};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergyregulatorIssuesPaperSemi2020}{Australian
Energy Regulator, 2020}).

Much like portfolio-based balancing in Europe, the aggregation of
contribution factors enables a market participant to offset antagonistic
deviations with assisting deviations (from the provision of
tight-deadband PFR) across its resources and time. However, the
complexity and opacity of the methodology and cost-allocation process
has contributed to the withdrawal of tight-deadband PFR in the NEM.
Several generators disabled governor response in the NOFB in the belief
that dispatch adherence alone will minimise Causer Pays liabilities
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-digsilentReviewFrequencyControl2017}{DIgSILENT,
2017}).

\hypertarget{nem-assessment-and-outlook}{%
\section{NEM assessment and outlook}\label{nem-assessment-and-outlook}}

Though the introduction of competitive FCAS markets in 2001 initially
resulted in significantly lower FCAS prices in the NEM
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015}{Riesz et
al., 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007}{Thorncraft
and Outhred, 2007}), volume-weighted average FCAS prices, particularly
those for raise regulation and contingency services, have increased
relative to the volume-weighted average energy price since 2016
(Figure~\ref{fig:raise_fcas_vwap}). Furthermore, the increases in
minimum regulation FCAS volumes and reductions in assumed load relief in
2019 have raised the procured volumes of regulation and contingency
FCAS, respectively. Together, these factors have contributed to higher
NEM-wide FCAS costs
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorReviewNEMLoad2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019e}). While quarterly FCAS costs were less
than 1\% of quarterly total NEM costs in 2015, 50\% of all quarters from
2017 to 2020 had FCAS costs that were between 1-2\% of total NEM cost
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2021}{Australian
Energy Regulator, 2021}).

\begin{figure}

which was islanded for approximately two weeks. Note that while average
energy prices fell in Q2-Q4 in 2020 to levels previously seen in
2014-2015 (due to lower demand during COVID-19 lockdowns), FCAS prices

\end{figure}

Prior to the implementation of mandatory PFR, higher NEM FCAS costs were
arguably not accompanied by an improvement in frequency control
performance. Alongside deteriorating frequency control performance
within the NOFB (Figure~\ref{fig:nofb_freq_2005_2018}), AEMO has
expressed a loss of confidence in the NEM's resilience to complex power
system events, such as the double separation incident on the
25\textsuperscript{th} of August 2018
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019b}). These events are typically more severe
than the `credible' contingency events (i.e.~N-1 contingency) that
dictate the volume of contingency FCAS procured.

Since the implementation of the mandatory PFR, settings specified by
AEMO have been applied to a majority of large synchronous generators
(\(>\) 200MW) and some smaller synchronous generators. Despite the
absence of requirements for maintaining headroom and/or footroom,
preliminary analysis by AEMO\footnote{The ramp rate used in dispatch by
  AEMO is the lesser of a telemetered rate or a ramp rate submitted in a
  resource's offer for energy, and was obtained using NEMOSIS
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018}{Gorman et al.,
  2018}).} suggests that mandatory PFR has delivered better control of
frequency within the NOFB (see Figure~\ref{fig:mpfr_dist}) and reduced
excursions beyond the NOFB
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021a}). As a result of this initial success and
further technical advice provided by AEMO, the AEMC has indicated that
it intends to retain mandatory PFR at a tight-deadband following the
``sunset'' of the initial rule
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionPrimaryFrequencyResponse2021}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2021a}).

\begin{figure}

Operator

}
\end{figure}

However, this initial success may be a result of the headroom maintained
by these generators for risk management purposes (e.g.~defending
contract positions) and any headroom made available to the system
through the displacement of more expensive synchronous capacity by VRE.
Given that several large synchronous generators are expected to retire
in the coming decades
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020IntegratedSystem2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020d}), continuing to rely on this ``free''
headroom (and any available footroom) into the future may reduce the
potential resilience benefits of widespread, tight-deadband PFR and
place a greater burden on generators that do reserve headroom and hence
respond. The AEMC is proposing to address this issue by paying resources
that provide assisting tight-deadband PFR (``double-siding'')
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionPrimaryFrequencyResponse2021}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2021a}).

Presently, several other operational and market changes are being
considered or implemented with the goal of improving the effectiveness
of arrangements in the NEM. AEMO is investigating the use of dispatch
constraints to
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFrequencyControlWork2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021g}):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Procure contingency FCAS volumes based on system inertia;
\item
  Apply regional contingency and regulation FCAS requirements; and
\item
  To limit the amount of switched contingency FCAS procured. Switched
  FCAS has a number of limitations compared to governor-like control
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020c}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020b}).
\end{itemize}

These additional constraints will likely improve the effectiveness of
frequency control arrangements but may lead to higher FCAS costs. In
addition to these procurement changes, the AEMC has made a rule to
introduce raise and lower contingency markets for FFR by October 2023,
each with a likely response time of 1 second
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFastFrequencyResponse2021}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2021b};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFastFrequencyResponse2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021h}). Whilst AEMO has highlighted that
potential stability issues and interconnector maloperation will need to
be managed (e.g.~through delivery caps or provision constraints)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorImplementationNationalElectricity2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021i}), these FFR markets, along with the ESB's
proposals for short-term scheduling and/or procurement of inertial
response
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021}{Energy
Security Board, 2021}), will likely improve AEMO's operational toolbox
for managing a low-inertia NEM.

\hypertarget{reactive-regulatory-requirements}{%
\subsection{Reactive regulatory
requirements}\label{reactive-regulatory-requirements}}

Despite a broad set of FCS markets, there is a high degree of reliance
on regulatory mechanisms in the NEM. Performance standards and mandatory
PFR enforced by connection requirements in the NEM have recently been
aligned with international grid-codes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-robertsReviewInternationalGrid2018}{Roberts,
2018}). As argued by TNSPs and AEMO during the mandatory PFR rule change
process, near-universal widespread provision of frequency control should
lead to relatively low costs for individual participants and be
outweighed by greater visibility and certainty for AEMO alongside the
system-wide benefits of improved physical frequency control performance
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019b};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-dillonMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019}{Dillon,
2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hopwoodMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019}{Hopwood,
2019}).

Regulatory mechanisms are ideal for mandating basic FCS capabilities as
a condition for access, which may reduce the need to procure more
specialised FCS, or where FCS faces significant barriers to efficient
price formation or unbundled procurement. The latter reasons are
particularly pertinent in the NEM. Current FCAS prices do not appear to
be incentivising FCS provision from the vast majority of VRE generators,
which have business models centred around energy provision
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionReserveServicesNational2021}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2021c};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021}{Meegahapola
et al., 2021}). Furthermore, procuring inertial response is challenging
due to its inseparability from system strength provision and unit
commitment costs
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020}{Billimoria et
al., 2020}). With respect to these challenges, regulatory mechanisms in
the NEM have assisted in ensuring some level of frequency response from
most power system resources (e.g.~mandatory PFR) and improving the
ability of AEMO and TNSPs to coordinate the procurement of essential but
``lumpy'' FCS (e.g.~inertia shortfall mechanism).

While mechanisms such as mandatory PFR are likely to improve the
robustness of frequency control arrangements, it may be difficult for
other regulatory mechanisms to keep in step with changing physical
performance requirements in systems rapidly facing higher penetrations
of VRE and IBR. Regulatory mechanisms are often only updated after a
number of years to reduce the burden placed on connecting resources. As
such, they are slow to respond to changing capabilities and
requirements. This delay often makes new standards and requirements
reactive rather than proactive. For example, AEMO can only review
utility-scale generator technical performance standards every 5 years
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionGeneratorTechnicalPerformance2018}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2018a}), a timeframe in which the solar PV
capacity installed in the NEM has more than quadrupled (2015-2020)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianpvinstituteInstalledPVGeneration}{Australian
PV Institute, n.d.}).

Additional concerns with regulatory mechanisms include poor dynamic
efficiency and opaque
costs(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015}{Riesz
et al., 2015}). In the absence of remuneration or incentives,
particularly those that are linked to the quality of frequency response,
there is no incentive to innovate or invest in higher-quality frequency
control capabilities
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021}{Meegahapola
et al., 2021}). Furthermore, cost opacity may lead to FCS provision
costs being internalised within other prices (e.g.~energy) by
participants and prevent the implementation of imbalance or dispatch
non-conformance disincentives through cost-allocation mechanisms.

\hypertarget{preference-for-market-based-arrangements}{%
\section{Preference for market-based
arrangements}\label{preference-for-market-based-arrangements}}

Since the establishment of the NEM, a competition norm has been
established, with markets being viewed as a key driver for delivering
the National Electricity Objective of ``efficient investment in, and
efficient operation and use of electricity services''
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hainesEnvironmentalNormsElectricity2016}{Haines
and McConnell, 2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-macgillElectricityMarketNorms2020}{MacGill et
al., 2020}). This norm has pervaded all levels of participation and
governance in the NEM. Generator owners opposed the mandatory nature of
the mandatory PFR rule change on the basis that a lack of remuneration
was against market principles and that it would lead to economically
inefficient outcomes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rolfeMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019}{Rolfe,
2019}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-scottMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019}{Scott,
2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-skinnerMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019}{Skinner,
2019}). AEMO did not include a headroom requirement in its proposal,
making the mandatory PFR rule change more palatable to market bodies and
participants. The AEMC, who have expressed a clear preference for
market-based approaches
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2018b}), included a ``sunset'' clause in their
initial decision to implement mandatory PFR. Furthermore, a market for
FFR will be implemented in 2023 and the ESB's post-2025 market design
process is considering new system services markets for inertial response
and TFR
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021}{Energy
Security Board, 2021},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2020}{2020}).

If incentives or remuneration are designed correctly, markets can drive
short-run efficiency. Where required, they can also support investment
in FCS capability and assist a power system in achieving dynamically
efficient frequency control arrangements. However, in some cases, simply
introducing new FCS markets may serve as `patchwork' solutions to
existing control deficiencies and market failures. These deficiencies
and failures could be partially addressed by improving FCS cost
allocation processes, verifying FCS performance and linking incentives
to higher quality provision.

As discussed in {[}Section~\ref{sec:fcs-context}), efficient Causer Pays
cost-allocation mechanisms in FCS markets could provide suitable
disincentives for dispatch non-conformance or imbalances. In the NEM,
the aggregation of regulation FCAS Causer Pays contribution factors over
time and a portfolio has resulted in a blunt frequency performance
market signal. The solution to this problem may not be as simple as
strengthening disincentives (e.g.~as proposed by Hirth and Ziegenhagen
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015}{2015}) and
Papavasiliou
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-papavasiliouScarcityPricingMissing2020}{2020}))
for resource-based cost-allocation processes as potential exposure to
high instantaneous FCS costs may lead to participants curtailing or
decommitting flexible resources rather than providing an assisting
frequency response. This has been observed in the NEM when local
constraints have resulted in regulation FCAS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2018b}) and contingency FCAS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorQuarterlyEnergyDynamics2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020j}) price spikes. The AEMC has proposed a
compromise to this problem by shortening the settlement period for
regulation FCAS Causer Pays to 5 minutes but only allocating the costs
of regulation FCAS capacity that is activated by AEMO (i.e.~the cost of
any unactivated capacity is socialised across power system users)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionPrimaryFrequencyResponse2021}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2021a}).

An alternative to Causer Pays is to allocate costs based on needs (`User
Pays'), such that connected equipment imposing RoCoF or frequency
constraints pay for FCS. `Users' of frequency control currently include
synchronous machines and IBR that have not been configured to
ride-through higher RoCoFs and greater frequency deviations. Following
more extreme frequency deviations, the former may suffer equipment
damage whereas both have the potential to trip
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016}{DGA
Consulting, 2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-millerAdvisoryEquipmentLimits2017}{Miller et al.,
2017a}). A User Pays approach to cost-allocation could encourage
resources to be more resilient to frequency deviations and thereby
reduce system FCS costs
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lalEssentialSystemServices2021}{Lal et al.,
2021}), particularly if a significant proportion of connected equipment
are IBR that can be configured to ride-through such disturbances.

Beyond choosing who costs should be allocated to and what an appropriate
granularity for cost-allocation might be, market designers should ensure
that the chosen methodology is transparent, can be understood by
participants and that any calculations can be replicated using
accessible data. If appropriate design choices are made, efficient
cost-allocation could create counter-parties for financial instruments
that hedge price risk
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-skinnerIncorporatingNewPower2020}{Skinner et
al., 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007}{Thorncraft
and Outhred, 2007}). FCS derivatives may drive investment in FCS
capabilities by supporting business models in which FCS is a major
revenue stream (this is currently the case for utility-scale BESS, DR
aggregators and virtual power plants in the NEM) and assist in FCS price
formation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020}{Billimoria et
al., 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019}{Pollitt
and Anaya, 2019}).

As in ISO/RTO Regulation markets, aligning FCS procurement and/or
remuneration with performance essentially recognises that there is a
spectrum of FCS capabilities. This recognition is lacking in the NEM,
where battery energy storage systems are responding precisely and
rapidly to AGC regulation signals but are being paid the same as thermal
plant that provide lower quality regulation FCAS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorInitialOperationHornsdale2018}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2018d}). However, implementing performance-based
design is contingent on the SO verifying FCS provision. While AEMO has
outlined FCAS delivery measurement standards and verification principles
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorMarketAncillaryService2020a}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020e}), delivery verification appears to be
restricted to confirming contingency FCAS delivery following a power
system event (to the authors' best knowledge). While a regular
verification process does not appear to be in place for regulation FCAS,
AEMO is proposing to specify minimum control requirements (e.g.~response
delay and ramp rate) and implement a regular testing cycle for resources
registered for regulation FCAS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorAmendmentMarketAncillary2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021j}).

Market designers may also need to consider price formation in FCS
markets to ensure that arrangements are at least capable of supporting
investment during energy transition. As discussed by Hirth and
Ziegenhagen
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015}{2015}), VRE
have low to no short-term energy market opportunity-costs when providing
lower/negative FCS but can incur significant short-term energy market
opportunity-costs when providing raise/positive FCS. The raise/positive
opportunity-cost may be even higher if the SO requires additional
curtailment to better ensure that FCS capacity is firm, which AEMO has
required, or if the resource has entered into an energy off-take
agreement, which is common in the NEM
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorHornsdaleWindFarm2018}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2018e}). While co-optimised FCS markets mean
that such opportunity-costs can be accounted for, FCS prices can be
suppressed if large conventional generators with low to no
opportunity-costs offer large volumes of FCS. Low prices can limit the
incentive for high capital, low operating cost IBR to provide and invest
in FCS capabilities. This may lead to a dynamically inefficient outcome
as additional conventional generators are retired and limited FCS
capabilities are offered by VRE and other IBR
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaFutureElectricityMarkets2019}{Ela et al.,
2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021}{Meegahapola
et al., 2021}). As discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:fcs-efficiency-challenges}, one potential solution to
this issue is to strengthen scarcity pricing in FCS markets. The AEMC
and ESB have discussed implementing system demand curves with scarcity
pricing for all existing and proposed FCAS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlRule2020}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2020c};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2020}{Energy
Security Board, 2020}). However, the shape of these system demand curves
and how they account for interdependent or interchangeable FCAS will
ultimately dictate their success.

\hypertarget{conclusion-1}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-1}}

Whilst recent years have seen increasing participation from demand
response and IBR, energy transition and a pervasive competition norm
have exposed design issues in the NEM's frequency control arrangements.
As such, considerable attention and effort have been devoted to
reforming the NEM's arrangements in the past two years.

From our review of North American and European frequency control
arrangements and our analysis of the NEM's, we share four key insights
below that could serve as design principles for operators, regulators
and market-bodies attempting to design effective and efficient frequency
control arrangements in restructured electricity industries during
energy transition:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Control deficiencies may not be addressable through introducing new
  FCS. While this solution may address emerging needs (e.g.~low-inertia
  operation), SOs and market bodies need to better understand the
  interdependency, interoperability and interchangeability between FCS
  and the interactions with other technical attributes of the power
  system (e.g.~system strength) to ensure that frequency control is
  first and foremost effective. Once this has been achieved, the
  short-run efficiency of arrangements can be improved through
  mechanisms such as dynamic and probabilistic dimensioning and
  co-optimising the procurement of interchangeable FCS.
\item
  Given the pace and scale of energy transition, a dynamically efficient
  outcome in some power systems may require additional investments in
  FCS capability. FCS prices can be strengthened through scarcity
  pricing, which may better reflect the system's preference for security
  and reliability. Such pricing mechanisms are complementary to
  appropriate and efficient cost-allocation based on causation or needs.
  Both efficient price formation and cost-allocation will improve the
  potential for FCS derivatives, which may assist in providing price
  signals for investment.
\item
  SOs should systematically and frequently verify FCS delivery, where
  relevant, and withhold or penalise remuneration when delivery is
  deemed to be insufficient. If such monitoring is in place, FCS
  remuneration can be performance-based to drive the provision of high
  quality FCS. Performance monitoring would also enable the SO to assess
  FCS arrangements and identify any deficiencies in control action or
  procurement.
\item
  During energy transition, a suitable set of frequency control
  arrangements will most likely involve a combination of market-based
  and regulatory mechanisms. Frequency control is a power system public
  good and achieving frequency stability requires a degree of
  coordination and cooperation between resources. These characteristics
  make it difficult to establish complete markets for FCS, and an
  emphasis on market solutions may obscure these characteristics to
  market participants and undermine effective control. In contrast,
  regulatory mechanisms may prove to be more robust and resilient in the
  face of uncertainties, particularly those that are exogenous to the
  power system (e.g.~climate risk). Regardless of whether arrangements
  are skewed towards market-based mechanisms or regulatory mechanisms,
  designers should be more forward-looking and avoid assumptions
  regarding the provision of FCS capability over time, particularly when
  there is a pervasive competition norm and effective frequency control
  relies on sequential and hierarchical control actions.

\section{Abstract}\label{abstract-2}}

Across several power systems with market frameworks, policy-makers are
proposing that balancing flexibility requirements emerging during energy
transition be addressed through new reserve product markets. However,
these may introduce additional costs, constraints and complexity and
even encroach upon the functions of existing operational practices.
Thus, policy-makers need to assess and compare flexibility design
options, and quantifying system flexibility capabilities based on
current and expected resource mixes can assist in achieving this. In
this article, we offer a practical method to quantify the time-varying
spectrum of upwards and downwards flexibility capabilities in systems,
and subsequently apply it to historical and projected resource mixes in
two regions of the Australian National Electricity Market. Our results
suggest that with higher penetrations of renewable energy: 1) downwards
flexibility margins can be exhausted around noon if wind and solar are
unable or unwilling to provide it, 2) upwards flexibility becomes more
scarce during morning and evening peak demand events and 3) a greater
portion of upwards flexibility is provided by energy-limited resources.
Given these trends, we recommend that policy-makers examine how existing
operational practices can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility
provision, and that duration specifications and sustained footroom
procurement be considered for reserve products.

\hypertarget{introduction-1}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

The reliable and secure operation of power systems is contingent upon
locational and temporal balancing of active power supply and demand. As
jurisdictions progressively decarbonise electricity supply through
considerable capacity additions of variable renewable energy (VRE) and
the retirement of carbon-intensive conventional generation, the nature
of short-term risks to system balancing (i.e.~those of concern over the
range of seconds to days) is changing. The most notable of these
short-term risks are
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaOperatingReservesVariable2011}{Ela et al.,
2011}):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Power system \emph{variability}, which includes expected changes in
  the supply-demand balance. Traditionally, variability has been
  associated with system load movements and fluctuations around
  pre-determined generator schedules. As energy transition proceeds,
  system operators (SOs) are becoming increasingly focused on managing
  variability that arises due to the presence of VRE. This includes the
  correlated ramping of neighbouring solar PV generation during sunrise
  and sunset, and that of wind generation following the arrival of a
  cold front
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020a};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-lewWesternWindSolar2013}{Lew et al., 2013}).
\item
  Power system \emph{uncertainty}, which encompasses unexpected changes
  in the supply-demand balance. Beyond demand and VRE generation
  forecast errors, uncertainty also includes singular or widespread
  outage events that could be the result of a sudden loss of primary
  energy availability, equipment malfunctions, or common mode failures
  either triggered by insecure system operation (e.g.~significant
  frequency and/or voltage deviations) or exogenous events (e.g.~extreme
  weather events)
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-electricitysectorclimateinformationprojectESCIProjectFinal2021}{Electricity
  Sector Climate Information Project, 2021};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-matevosyanFutureInverterBasedResources2021}{Matevosyan
  et al., 2021};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-redefiningresourceadequacytaskforceRedefiningResourceAdequacy2021}{Redefining
  Resource Adequacy Task Force, 2021}).
\end{itemize}

Provided that it is sufficient, leveraging the active power balancing
flexibility of a power system (defined by Heggarty et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-heggartyQuantifyingPowerSystem2020}{2020}) as a
system's ``ability to cope with variability and uncertainty'') should
enable these short-term risks to be managed. At a particular point in
time, the total balancing flexibility \emph{capability} of a power
system is the sum of potential flexibility contributions from resources
such as generators, flexible demand and energy storage. However, the
flexibility that can actually be \emph{deployed} at any given time and
location is potentially limited by:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Physical, economic, social and environmental constraints on the
  operation of resources
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-denholmHowLowCan2018}{Denholm et al., 2018};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-gonzalez-salazarReviewOperationalFlexibility2018}{Gonzalez-Salazar
  et al., 2018});
\item
  Network topology, particularly if deploying a flexibility solution
  results in the violation of network constraints
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lannoyeTransmissionVariableGeneration2015}{Lannoye
  et al., 2015}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-liuGridMarketServices2021}{Liu
  et al., 2021}); and
\item
  Operational practices. These include protocols and tools used by the
  SO (which is ultimately responsible for maintaining supply-demand
  balance) and electricity market design in power systems with a market
  overlay (\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaWholesaleElectricityMarket2016}{Ela
  et al., 2016}).
\end{enumerate}

Though it is well established that operational practices are crucial to
``enabling'' balancing flexibility provision
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015}{Hirth and
Ziegenhagen, 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hsiehGridFlexibilityQuiet2017}{Hsieh and
Anderson, 2017};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018}{Papaefthymiou
et al., 2018}), limited attention has been given to assessing the
trade-offs between practice changes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021}{Mays,
2021}). A typical design choice in power systems with electricity
markets is determining whether a balancing function should be performed
by the SO, or partially delegated to market participants via
market-based mechanisms. Proponents of market-based mechanisms argue
that if they are well-designed, their benefit is twofold: appropriate
incentives can unlock the efficient utilisation of latent flexibility
from existing resources whilst encouraging investment in additional
flexibility as a market-signalled need emerges. However, to some extent,
desires to maximise market benefits and minimise market distortions need
to be weighed against providing the SO with sufficient lead-time and
levers to maintain system balance during both normal and extraordinary
circumstances
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-prakashInsightsDesigningEffective2022}{Prakash
et al., 2022};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-roquesMarketDesignGeneration2008}{Roques, 2008}).

Establishing markets for balancing reserves offers a compromise between
SO control and market efficiency
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-kristovTaleTwoVisions2016}{Kristov et al.,
2016}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-ryanVariableGenerationReserves2014}{Ryan
et al., 2014}). These enable the SO to set a requirement for,
competitively procure and then schedule system \emph{headroom} (spare
generation capacity and potential load curtailment) or system
\emph{footroom} (potential generation curtailment and load increase)
with particular power, energy, ramping and quality-of-response
(e.g.~response time) capabilities
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-degefaComprehensiveClassificationsCharacterizations2021}{Degefa
et al., 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ulbigAnalyzingOperationalFlexibility2015}{Ulbig
and Andersson, 2015}). Whilst tailored \emph{reserve services} can be
procured through tendering processes, zonal or system-wide markets for
\emph{reserve products} have become increasingly commonplace given that
temporal balancing is of greater concern in meshed networks.
Additionally, ``commodification'' of capabilities through products
reduces complexity and enables the implementation of auctions, which can
improve transparency and competition and be co-optimised with energy or
other reserve product markets
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lalEssentialSystemServices2021}{Lal et al.,
2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021}{Mancarella and
Billimoria, 2021}).

The changing nature of short-term risks to system balancing and the
accompanying need for greater system flexibility is leading
policy-makers to reassess the suitability of the reserve products
available to their SOs
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021}{Energy
Security Board, 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-eu-sysflexProductDefinitionInnovative2019}{EU-SysFlex,
2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-federalenergyregulatorycommissionEnergyAncillaryServices2021}{Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 2021}). Reform of reserve arrangements can
simply modify procurement practices or lead to a more significant
restructuring of available products, which includes introducing new
markets (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ryanVariableGenerationReserves2014}{Ryan
et al., 2014}). Particularly in their initial stages, reform processes
tend to justify changes on the basis of how they might address potential
threats to system balancing. This approach is appropriate and sufficient
where reserve service provision entails specialised quality-of-response
capabilities that cannot be provided effectively or efficiently through
other means (e.g.~high bandwidth control configurations required for
fast frequency response provision). However, some reserve products may
``compete'' with other design options. For example, the purpose and
timeframe of tertiary frequency control and ramping products overlap
with those of dispatch processes. Where reserve arrangement reform
encroaches on the functions of other processes and practices,
quantifying system flexibility capabilities based on current and
expected resources mixes can assist policy-makers in assessing
flexibility design options.

Reserve products also impose tangible and intangible costs. Regardless
of cost allocation mechanisms, procuring reserves typically raises
system operation costs and thus prices paid by energy users
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-hummonFundamentalDriversCost2013}{Hummon et al.,
2013}). Furthermore, even if they offer a solution to a system
sub-problem, reserve products do not guarantee reliable operation of the
overall system and may even hinder the implementation of other measures
that can realise system flexibility
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020}{MacGill
and Esplin, 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018}{Papaefthymiou
et al., 2018};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019}{Pollitt
and Anaya, 2019}). For example, valuing balancing flexibility on the
scale of minutes to hours through reserve products could mean
sacrificing the benefits of better reflecting the value of flexibility
in energy prices:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  For participants, energy market risk management is more
  straightforward than managing risk in reserve product markets.
  Short-term energy markets typically have greater depth and a broader
  range of associated technical or financial forward markets
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019}{Pollitt
  and Anaya, 2019}).
\item
  Reserve product markets often have pre-qualification criteria and
  minimum offer quantities. As such, the participation of smaller
  demand-side and distributed energy resources (DER) in reserve product
  markets is often contingent on the involvement of an intermediary
  aggregator, which imposes additional transaction costs
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019}{Poplavskaya
  and de Vries, 2019}). However, embedding the value of flexibility
  within the price for energy could simplify flexibility provision
  through market participation for these resources, particularly if
  policy-makers pursue dynamic retail pricing or nested
  distribution-level markets that interface with transmission-level
  markets (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hoganMarketDesignPractices2019}{Hogan,
  2019}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-kristovTaleTwoVisions2016}{Kristov et
  al., 2016};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021}{Mays,
  2021}).
\item
  The flexibility that the SO is able to procure through reserve
  products is restricted by their product specifications. Solely relying
  on reserve products for flexibility may constrain operational
  outcomes. Such flexibility ``discretisation'' might also be reflected
  in the resources deployed in the system should reserve product markets
  influence investment decisions
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lalEssentialSystemServices2021}{Lal et al.,
  2021}). Additionally, whilst reserve products can be tailored to a
  particular system's capabilities and needs, reserve sharing between SO
  jurisdictions is easier if technical specifications are standardised
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-schererFrequencyControlEuropean2016}{Scherer,
  2016}).
\end{enumerate}

Given these factors, quantification and comparison are therefore needed
to assess the role of reserve products, particularly where
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaElectricityMarketFuture2021}{Ela et al.,
2021}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007}{Y.
Rebours et al., 2007}):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Other operational practice or policy changes have the potential to
  deliver greater and/or more robust flexibility benefits without the
  additional costs, uncertainty and complexity of new markets; or
\item
  Current market design or exogenous resource adequacy policies
  (e.g.~firming revenue guarantees or capacity markets) are driving
  sufficient investment in flexible resources.
\end{enumerate}

A plethora of metrics that quantify different aspects of system
balancing flexibility capabilities have been proposed in the literature
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-heggartyQuantifyingPowerSystem2020}{Heggarty et
al., 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-lannoyePowerSystemFlexibility2012}{Lannoye et
al., 2012a};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-mohandesReviewPowerSystem2019}{Mohandes et al.,
2019}). Rather than solely quantifying flexibility capabilities,
operational metrics typically compare short-term flexibility
capabilities against a flexibility requirement that is set by one of the
following or a combination thereof: rules-of-thumb, net load
variability, net load forecast uncertainty and/or probabilistic VRE
forecasts. While an SO can use these metrics to identify potential
flexibility shortages
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-zhaoUnifiedFrameworkDefining2016}{Zhao et al.,
2016}), dimension reserve products
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-costilla-enriquezOperatingDynamicReserve2023}{Costilla-Enriquez
et al., 2023};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-dvorkinAssessingFlexibilityRequirements2014}{Dvorkin
et al., 2014}) or schedule resources
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-nosairFlexibilityEnvelopesPower2015}{Nosair and
Bouffard, 2015}), they may be less useful to system designers assessing
changes to practices that leverage decentralised decision-making
(e.g.~energy and reserve product markets). Broader planning-oriented
flexibility capability metrics may be more suitable for such purposes.
These include traditional resource adequacy metrics
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-stenclikQuantifyingRiskUncertain2021}{Stenclik
et al., 2021}), ``inflexibility costs'' (e.g.~additional system costs
due to flexibility constraints as explored in Vithayasrichareon et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-vithayasrichareonOperationalFlexibilityFuture2017}{2017}))
or ``flexibility adequacy'' metrics, such as the insufficient ramping
resource expectation proposed in Lannoye et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lannoyeEvaluationPowerSystem2012}{2012b}). In
particular, Lannoye et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lannoyeEvaluationPowerSystem2012}{2012b}) uses
time-sequential power system operations data to explicitly calculate the
balancing flexibility available after resources are dispatched, though
valuable chronological information is lost when the time series
generated in the study are converted into probability distributions to
calculate the insufficient ramping resource expectation. By retaining a
degree of this chronological information, our methodology aims to
provide electricity industry stakeholders with a better understanding of
the time-varying ``spectrum'' of system balancing flexibility
capabilities, and thus assist them in assessing, comparing and designing
potential operational practice changes to improve flexibility in power
systems with a growing number of variable and energy-limited resources.

In this article, we offer a practical method for quantifying available
reserves and footroom (the balancing flexibility that is available after
resources are dispatched to meet system demand), and an example of how
such quantification can inform flexible electricity market design. We
provide simple extensions to the methodology developed by Lannoye et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lannoyeEvaluationPowerSystem2012}{2012b}) that
account for flexibility contributions from VRE and battery energy
storage systems (BESS), and market participants' aversions to incurring
cycling costs. We then use this methodology in a case study in which we
quantify time-varying available reserves and footroom in real-world
systems: two regions of the Australian National Electricity Market
(NEM). Through a 2020 baseline and two 2025 scenarios, we test four key
sensitivities in these two regions: the acceleration of large
conventional generation retirement, the rate of deployment of VRE and
storage technologies, contrasting resource mixes and operational
constraints, and greater variability in operational demand. While
previous studies have tested the impact of some of these sensitivities
on the availability of total system headroom or existing reserve
products
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-frewCurtailmentParadoxTransition2021}{Frew et
al., 2021b};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-hummonFundamentalDriversCost2013}{Hummon et al.,
2013}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-tanotoImpactHighSolar2021}{Tanoto et al.,
2021}), our analysis offers a perspective that is focused on quantifying
a time-varying spectrum of flexibility capabilities and thus concerned
with the \emph{design} of operational practices in low-carbon power
systems. Our analysis results highlight the underappreciated need to
consider mechanisms for procuring footroom, and we proceed to discuss
the implications of implementing new balancing products on operational
outcomes. Though the NEM is unique in aspects of its operational
practices and the balancing risks it faces, the methodology and findings
from this study will become increasingly relevant in other jurisdictions
given the accelerating deployment of VRE and storage and the progressive
retirement of carbon-intensive conventional generation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-internationalenergyagencyNetZero20502021}{International
Energy Agency, 2021},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-internationalenergyagencyStatusPowerSystem2019}{2019}).

Section~\ref{sec:reserves-flexnem} provides an overview of how balancing
flexibility is enabled and procured through the NEM's operational
practices and market design. In
Section~\ref{sec:reserves-modeloverview}, we describe a methodology to
quantify available reserves and footroom across deployment horizons for
various resource types. Then, in Section~\ref{sec:reserves-casestudy},
we quantify the available reserves and footroom in two regions of the
NEM for existing resource mixes in 2020 and potential resources mixes in
2025, with two scenarios for the latter. We then use the findings from
this case study to explore the role of reserve products in securing
balancing flexibility. We conclude by highlighting pertinent findings
and recommendations to policy-makers in
Section~\ref{sec:reserves-conclusion}.

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-flexnem}{%
\section{Flexibility in the National Electricity
Market}\label{sec:reserves-flexnem}}

The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is a short-term
wholesale electricity market overlaid on a \textasciitilde5000 kilometre
long ``stringy'' network that services the majority of eastern and
southern Australia
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionElectricitySupplyChain}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, n.d.b}). In 2021, it saw a peak demand of
\textasciitilde32 GW and total electricity consumption of
\textasciitilde204 TWh
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2022}{Australian
Energy Regulator, 2022}). With no explicit capacity mechanisms or
compulsory forward markets, the NEM solely consists of a zonal real-time
platform, with market regions corresponding to the states of Queensland,
New South Wales (NSW), Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia (SA).
Interconnection between market regions is relatively weak and, due to
the large distances involved, the NEM is not connected to other bulk
power systems
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorMaintainingPowerSystem2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019a}).

In the subsections that follow, we describe the operation of the NEM
with a focus on features and mechanisms that enable or explicitly
procure balancing flexibility. In particular, we discuss current reserve
arrangements in the NEM in Section~\ref{sec:reserves-nemreserves} and
the proposal to introduce an \emph{operating reserve} product in
Section~\ref{sec:reserves-orcontext}. The policy debate surrounding the
usefulness and design of this potential reserve product provides the
primary motivation for our case study in
Section~\ref{sec:reserves-casestudy}.

\hypertarget{market-design}{%
\subsection{Market design}\label{market-design}}

\hypertarget{real-time-markets}{%
\subsubsection{Real-time markets}\label{real-time-markets}}

The NEM is a central dispatch market that is operated by the Australian
Energy Market Operator (AEMO). On the day ahead of delivery, market
participants are required to submit non-binding offers for each resource
consisting of price-quantity pairs for energy and, optionally, Frequency
Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) (described in Section
Section~\ref{sec:reserves-nemreserves})
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPredispatchOperatingProcedure2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021k}). Energy offers can be priced as high as
the market price cap (15,000 AUD/MW/hour during the Australian financial
year of 2020-2021) or as low as the market floor (-1000 AUD/MW/hour).
Negative pricing enables generators to express a preference to either
remain online due to significant start-up/shut-down costs or to be
dispatched as a price-taker when it is commercially favourable to do so
(e.g.~to receive remuneration from an offtake agreement). In theory, it
also provides investment signals for flexible resources alongside a
relatively high market price cap
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-orvisRefiningCompetitiveElectricity2018}{Orvis
and Aggarwal, 2018};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszAssessingViabilityEnergyonly2016}{Riesz et
al., 2016}).

On the day of delivery, co-optimised markets for energy and FCAS are
cleared every 5 minutes through a security-constrained economic dispatch
process, which produces zonal marginal prices for energy and FCAS. There
is no formal gate closure in the NEM; participants are able to alter
volumes (but not prices) in their offer up to tens of seconds before the
delivery interval
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionBiddingGoodFaith2015}{Australian
Energy Market Commission, 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-paulmcardleTwoRecentImprovements2021}{Paul
McArdle, 2021}). In 2021, the market settlement period was changed from
30 minutes (the average of prices of the preceding six 5-minute
intervals) to 5 minutes to better align settlement with dispatch and
pricing
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator5MSCommencement2022}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2022a}). Since resources are expected to
linearly ramp between one dispatch target and the next, the dispatch
process implicitly ``procures'' some flexibility to manage variability
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorDispatchStandardOperating2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021d};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ryanVariableGenerationReserves2014}{Ryan et al.,
2014}). As such, the NEM's dispatch is relatively fast and granular when
compared to short-term electricity markets worldwide
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-katzOpeningMarketsDesigning2019}{Katz et al.,
2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022}{Silva-Rodriguez
et al., 2022}).

The NEM's real-time market is also able to elicit balancing flexibility
provision from a variety of resources:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Unlike some North American markets that permit large proportions of
  the generation fleet to self-schedule
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-elaWholesaleElectricityMarket2016}{Ela et al.,
  2016};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-orvisRefiningCompetitiveElectricity2018}{Orvis
  and Aggarwal, 2018}), generation with a capacity above 30 MW is
  required to participate in the real-time market and receive dispatch
  instructions
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionNonscheduledGenerationLoad2017}{Australian
  Energy Market Commission, 2017}). This exposes larger utility-scale
  resources, which make up the bulk of the NEM's generation capacity, to
  price signals that somewhat reflect system balancing requirements.
\item
  VRE forecasts used in dispatch can be generated by AEMO or provided by
  market participants; due to very late gate closure, both are able to
  incorporate telemetered operational data from the minutes preceding
  delivery
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSemiScheduledGenerationDispatch2018}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2018f},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSchedulingErrorReport2016}{2016}).
\item
  In 2021, a wholesale demand response mechanism was implemented to
  enable larger loads (aggregated or otherwise) and virtual power plants
  (VPPs) to directly participate in the energy market\footnote{For all
    conventional resources, the distribution of offer prices resembles
    ``hockey-stick'' offer curves that are common in the NEM
    (\protect\hyperlink{ref-energysynapseDemandResponseNational2020}{Energy
    Synapse, 2020}) and in other electricity markets
    (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hurlbutProtectingMarketHockey2004}{Hurlbut
    et al., 2004}). Moreover, for most peaking conventional resources,
    energy is offered at or just above the strike price of cap
    options/futures (300 AUD/MWh).}
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorWholesaleDemandReponse2020}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020k}).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{forward-markets}{%
\subsubsection{Forward markets}\label{forward-markets}}

In the NEM, forward energy markets are voluntary and primarily consist
of the trading of electricity derivatives between market participants.
Though market participants can contract over-the-counter, the majority
of forward market activity occurs on two market exchanges for standard
products for periods up to 3 years out
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-asxenergyAustralianElectricityMarket2021}{ASX
Energy, 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2021}{Australian
Energy Regulator, 2021}). These standard products include quarterly or
annual futures, which fix a price for an agreed quantity of energy, and
caps, which are essentially call options that enable contract purchasers
(typically electricity retailers) to pay no more than the strike price
of 300 AUD/MWh for energy at the cost of a premium paid to the seller.
Contract markets in SA are considered to be relatively illiquid compared
to those in NSW, Queensland and Victoria
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2022}{Australian
Energy Regulator, 2022}). Beyond enabling market participants to hedge
real-time market price risk, products traded on the forward markets may
`discipline' market participants into offering balancing flexibility to
the system. For example, a generating market participant that sells
futures and caps is likely to retain some reliable generation capacity
in reserve to avoid large payouts in the event of high real-time prices
or the failure of their other plants
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszAssessingViabilityEnergyonly2016}{Riesz et
al., 2016}).

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\subsubsection{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

Despite the arguably world-leading flexible design of its real-time
markets, there are some notable limitations in the NEM and its
associated forward markets:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To date, the balancing flexibility offered by DER has primarily been
  leveraged through unremunerated, last-resort curtailment of
  distributed solar PV in SA by AEMO
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorOperatingGridHigh2021}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2021l}) or through aggregated solar-battery
  VPPs. At the end of 2021, VPPs had a registered capacity of
  approximately 30 MW
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kuiperWhatStateVirtual2022}{Kuiper, 2022}), a
  small percentage of the \textasciitilde15 GW of distributed solar PV
  capacity installed in the NEM as of June 2022
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianpvinstituteInstalledPVGeneration}{Australian
  PV Institute, n.d.}).
\item
  Aside from the procurement of footroom that is only deployed following
  frequency excursions (Section~\ref{sec:reserves-nemreserves}), there
  are currently no mechanisms in the NEM that remunerate resources for
  providing sustained downwards flexibility to the system.
\item
  Standard derivative products have remained much the same for decades
  despite changes in the NEM's resource mix and market dynamics. In
  particular, the 300 AUD/MWh strike price of cap contracts does not
  necessarily reflect a resource's operating costs (e.g.~the price of
  natural gas or the charging/pumping price for BESS/pumped hydro energy
  storage). While a demonstration project trialled a market platform for
  derivatives designed to be sold by flexible resources (e.g.~a ``Super
  Peak'' contract that enables buyers to hedge morning and evening
  demand peaks), these are nascent products with small traded volumes to
  date
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-renewableenergyhubRenewableEnergyHub2021}{Renewable
  Energy Hub, 2021}).
\item
  AEMO has little visibility and no direct oversight over the voluntary
  forward markets, which are currently operated by the financial
  services sector. Moreover, even if AEMO did, it would likely be
  difficult for them to determine how portfolio-based contracting might
  influence the operation of particular resources
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionShortTermForward2020}{Australian
  Energy Market Commission, 2020d}).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-ahead_soint}{%
\subsection{Ahead processes and operator
intervention}\label{sec:reserves-ahead_soint}}

Through several ahead processes, AEMO regularly publishes forecasted
system and market information to assess power system reliability and
assist market participant decision-making. The processes most relevant
to operational decision-making include the near-term Projected
Assessment of System Adequacy (PASA) and pre-dispatch simulations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Using forecasts for demand and VRE, a simplified set of forecasted
  network constraints and participant-submitted resource availabilities
  and energy constraints, the Pre-Dispatch PASA and Short Term PASA (run
  every half-hour and hour, respectively) both assess the maximum
  generation reserves available in each region for the next 7 trading
  days. PASA outputs include half-hourly available generation and system
  load forecasts
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionUpdatingShortTerm2022}{Australian
  Energy Market Commission, 2022};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorReliabilityStandardImplementation2020}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020l},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermPASA2012}{2012}).
\item
  Once day-ahead offers have been submitted by market participants, AEMO
  uses these offers in pre-dispatch processes alongside forecasts for
  constraints, demand and VRE. Pre-dispatch simulations then produce
  forecasts for dispatch conditions and regional prices for energy and
  FCAS. These are run every half hour at half-hourly resolution until
  the end of the next trading day (pre-dispatch) and at 5 minute
  resolution for the next hour (5 minute pre-dispatch)
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPreDispatch}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, n.d.},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPredispatchOperatingProcedure2021}{2021k}).
  The potential impacts of demand forecast error on regional energy
  prices and interconnector flows are explored through a sensitivity
  analysis
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPreDispatchSensitivities2021}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2021m}).
\end{itemize}

Regional balancing stress is indicated by the level of in-market
reserves, which is the total offered generation capacity in excess of
forecast regional demand\footnote{This measure does not consider the
  horizon within which the capacity can be converted to generation
  (i.e.~the reserve horizon).}. Should the Short Term PASA or
pre-dispatch processes forecast in-market reserves below specific
trigger levels, AEMO must issue market notices that declare forecast
Lack of Reserve (LOR) conditions
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermReserve2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021n}). Trigger levels are set by the maximum
of either deterministic generation contingencies (i.e.~below N-2 for
LOR1, below N-1 for LOR2 and no in-market reserves for LOR3), or a
particular confidence level of a probability distribution of total
forecasting errors generated by a Bayesian Belief Network, which is
trained on historical forecast errors and power system conditions
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorReserveLevelDeclaration2018}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2018g}).

The intention of these ahead process and LOR notices is to provide
market participants with information that might elicit a response, such
as shifting planned maintenance or rescheduling flexible resources in
response to forecasted tight supply-demand balance conditions. However,
if more severe LOR2 or LOR3 notices have been issued and AEMO deems that
the market response is insufficient by a certain time, AEMO can
intervene in the market by issuing directions (manual dispatch),
activating emergency reserves procured through the Reliability and
Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT) and/or instructing transmission network
operators to shed load
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermReserve2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021n},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorReserveLevelDeclaration2018}{2018g}).

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-nemreserves}{%
\subsection{Reserve products}\label{sec:reserves-nemreserves}}

Formal reserves arrangements in the NEM consist of eight FCAS and the
Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT). In each dispatch
interval, FCAS are procured by AEMO from markets for raise (headroom)
and lower (footroom) regulation FCAS, which are used to provide
frequency control during normal operation, and three raise and lower
contingency FCAS, which deliver their full response within 6 seconds, 60
seconds or 5 minutes following a major imbalance event. The volumes of
FCAS procured for each dispatch interval are dynamically determined,
with regulation FCAS procurement volumes dictated by power system time
error and contingency FCAS procurement volumes typically corresponding
to an N-1 contingency. In the absence of regional constraints, FCAS are
procured for and from all regions of the NEM. While FCAS provides
balancing flexibility through frequency-responsive headroom and
footroom, they predominantly respond to intra-dispatch variability and
uncertainty with the expectation that deployed resources will be
relieved by 5-minute dispatch
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-prakashInsightsDesigningEffective2022}{Prakash
et al., 2022};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015}{Riesz et al.,
2015}). 5 minute contingency FCAS is an exception, given that its
response may be called upon for up to 10 minutes. 5 minute contingency
FCAS is currently provided by a diverse range of resources (see
Figure~\ref{fig:raise_delayed_supply}).

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:raise_delayed_supply}{%
\centering
\includegraphics{source/figures/raise5minq42020.png}
\caption[Q4 2020 5-minute contingency FCAS global supply curve by
resource type]{Q4 2020 global supply curves by resource type for the
raise 5 minute contingency FCAS market. Each of the supply curves are
truncated to the volumes of 5 minute contingency FCAS procured by AEMO
across the NEM in that dispatch interval (NEM-wide mean of
\textasciitilde420 MW for Q4 2020). Providers include conventional steam
and hydropower generators, an aluminium smelter, demand response (DR)
aggregators, VPPs and BESS. As each supply curve is constructed from the
offers of resources across the NEM (i.e.~global), they do not reflect
dispatch outcomes in the presence of regional constraints. Offer and
dispatch data were obtained using NEMOSIS (Gorman et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018}{2018})).}\label{fig:raise_delayed_supply}
}
\end{figure}

Through the RERT, AEMO can obtain last-resort reserves given between 1
week to 1 year of notice of forecasted in-market reserves shortfalls.
While procurement practices vary depending on the notice time, RERT
procurement consists of AEMO contracting with out-of-market resources.
Following forecast or actual LOR2 or LOR3 conditions and an insufficient
market response, AEMO is able to activate RERT reserves
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionreliabilitypanelReliabilityEmergencyReserve2020}{Australian
Energy Market Commission Reliability Panel, 2020};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorProcedureExerciseReliability2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021o}). The RERT provides AEMO with a
last-resort mechanism to procure balancing flexibility prior to any
potential load shedding. However, resources that provide reserves
through the RERT are unable to participate in the real-time market for
the duration of their contract. After RERT reserves are activated,
market participants are remunerated based on counterfactual pricing
(i.e.~dispatch without RERT), thus maintaining scarcity pricing and
potential signals for investment.

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-orcontext}{%
\subsubsection{Operating reserves
product}\label{sec:reserves-orcontext}}

An inter-dispatch operating reserve product has been proposed in the
NEM. It would enable AEMO to procure headroom, which would need to be
available to the real-time market within the product horizon, in each
dispatch interval. Horizons of 5 minutes and 30 minutes were proposed
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSubmissionAEMCDirections2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021p};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021}{Energy
Security Board, 2021}). Market bodies and participants have raised
several potential benefits of an operating reserve product:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  It could address both inter-dispatch variability and uncertainty.
  Market bodies consider that the need to address the latter may be more
  material due to the growing impact of forecast uncertainty on system
  balancing and the potential for high impact, low probability power
  system events leading to extraordinary system imbalances
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionReserveServicesNational2021}{Australian
  Energy Market Commission, 2021c};
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-egglestonSecurityResilienceTechnical2021}{Eggleston
  et al., 2021}).
\item
  AEMO supports a 30+ minute horizon, as a longer timeframe product is
  likely to have a larger pool of providers and provide
  participants/AEMO with more lead time prior to any potential market
  intervention
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSubmissionAEMCDirections2021}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2021p}).
\item
  Through reserve constraints and potential scarcity pricing through an
  operating reserve demand curve
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hoganElectricityScarcityPricing2013}{Hogan,
  2013}), the product could act as an energy `price-adder'. This would
  enable real-time market prices for energy to better reflect consumers'
  preference for reliability
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017}{Cramton,
  2017}). Although the NEM's market price cap is high by international
  standards, it is generally well below the estimated value of

  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergyregulatorValuesCustomerReliability2019}{Australian
  Energy Regulator, 2019}). A `price-adder' could also provide sharper
  investment signals for flexible resources.
\end{enumerate}

The assessment of reserve capabilities to justify this new product has
been limited. AEMO has previously analysed ramping capabilities over
timeframes greater than 30 minutes
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020a}), the total reserve capacity available
within various timeframes across NEM regions and years
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSubmissionAEMCDirections2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021p}) and regularly forecasts in-market
reserves (Section~\ref{sec:reserves-ahead_soint}). However, these
studies do not consider flexibility capability available \emph{after}
resources are dispatched, or do not explore the time-varying spectrum of
this capability. Using the methodology outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:reserves-modeloverview}, we incorporate these elements
when quantifying balancing flexibility capabilities in NSW and SA to
inform an assessment of the operational benefits of additional balancing
products (Section~\ref{sec:reserves-casestudy}).

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-modeloverview}{%
\section{Modelling Available Reserves and
Footroom}\label{sec:reserves-modeloverview}}

To quantify balancing flexibility capabilities, we consider headroom and
footroom that can be converted to stable active power output within a
particular time \emph{horizon}. We will refer to these as
\emph{available reserves} and \emph{available footroom}\footnote{We use
  terminology consistent with Lannoye et al.
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lannoyeTransmissionVariableGeneration2015}{2015}),
  which quantifies \emph{available} flexibility considering resource
  operational constraints and \emph{realisable} flexibility considering
  both network and resource operational constraints. These types of
  flexibility exclude transient power changes from phenomena such as
  inertial response.}, respectively. Though these metrics do not
explicitly consider whether resources are frequency-responsive, how long
a potential response can be sustained for and whether network
constraints restrain flexibility provision, calculating these quantities
is broadly useful for understanding the balancing flexibility that could
be deployed in a meshed system within operational timeframes (minutes to
hours).

\hypertarget{quantifying-available-reserves-and-footroom}{%
\subsection{Quantifying available reserves and
footroom}\label{quantifying-available-reserves-and-footroom}}

At a given point in time and for a particular horizon, the available
reserves and footroom that a resource can offer are dependent on its
operational constraints, its synchronisation status and its active power
output. The latter two can be obtained from historical data, or as the
outputs of production-cost or market modelling.

Below, we outline a methodology for calculating system-wide available
reserves and footroom (Section~\ref{sec:reserves-syscalc}). We adapt the
methodology proposed by Lannoye et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-lannoyeEvaluationPowerSystem2012}{2012b}) to
calculate available reserves and footroom from conventional resources
(coal-fired, hydro and gas-fired generation -
Section~\ref{sec:reserves-conventionalcalc}), and propose simple
extensions for calculating available reserves and footroom provided by
VRE (Section~\ref{sec:reserves-vrecalc}) and BESS
(Section~\ref{sec:reserves-besscalc}). The nomenclature used in these
sections is described in Section~\ref{sec:reserves-nomenclature}.

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-conventionalcalc}{%
\subsubsection{Conventional
resources}\label{sec:reserves-conventionalcalc}}

The quantities of reserves and footroom that can be made available by
conventional resources are dependent on whether the resource is online
(non-zero active power output) or offline.

A conventional resource unit is considered to be online if
\(g_{r_c, t} > 0\). The reserves that an online conventional resource
unit can make available within the horizon \(h\) (\(AR_{r_c,h,t}^{ON}\))
is given by:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:convonres}{}{AR_{r_c,h,t}^{ON} = \begin{cases}
          \mathrm{StartUp}_{r_c} \times h & 0 < g_{r_c,t} < \mathrm{MSL}_{r_c}, h \leq \mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t} \\
          \min(\\ \hspace{0.2cm}(\mathrm{MSL}_{r_c} - g_{r_c,t}) + \mathrm{RampUp}_{r_c} \times (h - \mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t}),\\ \hspace{0.2cm}\overline{g}_{r_c,t} - g_{r_c,t}\\) & 0 < g_{r_c,t} < \mathrm{MSL}_{r_c}, h > \mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t} \\
          \min(\mathrm{RampUp}_{r_c} \times h, \overline{g}_{r_c,t} - g_{r_c,t}) & g_{r_c,t} \geq \mathrm{MSL}_{r_c}
      \end{cases}}\label{eq:convonres}\end{equation}

The three conditions in Equation~\ref{eq:convonres} reflect the
following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The unit is in its start-up sequence (i.e.~\(0<g_{r_c,t}\) \textless{}
  \(\mathrm{MSL}_{r_c}\)) and the reserve horizon (\(h\)) is shorter
  than or equal to the unit's start-up time (\(\mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t}\)).
  In this case, the start-up ramp rate (\(\mathrm{StartUp}_{r_c}\))
  dictates the quantity of reserves that the unit can provide.
\item
  The unit is in its start-up sequence and the reserve horizon (\(h\))
  is longer than the unit's start-up time (\(\mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t}\)). In
  this case, the quantity of reserves that the unit can provide is the
  minimum of the total unit ramping potential within the reserve horizon
  (at rate \(\mathrm{StartUp}_{r_c}\) up to the unit's minimum stable
  level, and \(\mathrm{RampUp}_{r_c}\) beyond it) and the unit's
  headroom.
\item
  The unit is operating above its minimum stable level. The quantity of
  reserves that the unit can provide is the minimum of the total unit
  ramping potential within the reserve horizon (at rate
  \(\mathrm{RampUp}_{r_c}\)) and the unit's headroom.
\end{enumerate}

The reserves that an offline conventional resource unit can make
available within the horizon \(h\) is given by
Equation~\ref{eq:convoffres}, which has two conditions that resemble the
first two conditions of Equation~\ref{eq:convonres}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:convoffres}{}{AR_{r_c,h,t}^{OFF} = \begin{cases}
          \mathrm{StartUp}_{r_c} \times h & g_{r_c,t}=0, h \leq \mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t} \\
          \min(\\ \hspace{0.2cm} \mathrm{MSL}_{r_c} + \mathrm{RampUp}_{r_c} \times (h-\mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t}),\\ \hspace{0.2cm} \overline{g}_{r_c,t} - g_{r_c,t}\\) & g_{r_c,t}=0,  h>\mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t}
       \end{cases}}\label{eq:convoffres}\end{equation}

To ensure that flexibility quantification only considers stable changes
in active power output, footroom from conventional resource units is
defined to be the maximum downwards flexibility they can provide without
shutting down (i.e.~down to their MSL). As such, footroom can only be
provided by online units operating above their MSL (first condition in
Equation~\ref{eq:convonfoot}):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:convonfoot}{}{AF_{r_c,h,t}^{ON} = \begin{cases}
          \min(\mathrm{RampDown}_{r_c} \times h, g_{r_c,t} - \mathrm{MSL}_{r_c}) & g_{r_c,t} > \mathrm{MSL}_{r_c} \\
          0 & 0 < g_{r_c,t} \leq \mathrm{MSL}_{r_c}
      \end{cases}}\label{eq:convonfoot}\end{equation}

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-vrecalc}{%
\subsubsection{Variable renewable energy}\label{sec:reserves-vrecalc}}

Within the availability of their primary energy source and the
timeframes of concern in this study, VRE are considered to be highly
flexible
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-holttinenDesignOperationEnergy2021}{Holttinen et
al., 2021};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-nelsonInvestigatingEconomicValue2018}{Nelson et
al., 2018}). Therefore, the provision of available reserves
(\(AR_{r_v, h, t}\)) and footroom (\(AF_{r_v, h, t}\)) by VRE is not
limited by ramp rates but rather by headroom and footroom:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:vreres}{}{ AR_{r_v,h,t}= g^f_{r_v,t}-g_{r_v,t}}\label{eq:vreres}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:vrefoot}{}{ AF_{r_v,h,t}=g_{r_v,t}}\label{eq:vrefoot}\end{equation}

In this study, \(g_{r_v,t} < g^f_{r_v,t}\) can occur as the result of
VRE curtailment due to oversupply.

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-besscalc}{%
\subsubsection{Battery energy storage
systems}\label{sec:reserves-besscalc}}

BESS are also highly flexible and, unlike other resource types, can
provide additional flexibility by switching from charging
(\(g_{r_b, t} < 0\)) to discharging (\(g_{r_b,t} > 0\)), or vice-versa.
This additional flexibility can be accounted for by including the
maximum power capacity of the BESS (\(\overline{g}_{r_b,t}\), which
restricts BESS charging and discharging such that
\(|g_{r_b,t}| \leq \overline{g}_{r_b,t}\)) in the equations for
available reserves (Equation~\ref{eq:bessres}) and available footroom
(Equation~\ref{eq:bessfoot}):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:bessres}{}{ AR_{r_b,h,t}=\overline{g}_{r_b,t}-g_{r_b,t}}\label{eq:bessres}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:bessfoot}{}{ AF_{r_b,h,t}=\overline{g}_{r_b,t}+g_{r_b,t}}\label{eq:bessfoot}\end{equation}

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-syscalc}{%
\subsubsection{System-wide}\label{sec:reserves-syscalc}}

At time \(t\), the total reserves and footroom that can be made
available to the system within the horizon \(h\) are given by
Equation~\ref{eq:restotal} and Equation~\ref{eq:foottotal},
respectively:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:restotal}{}{ AR_{h,t}=\sum_{r_c \in \mathcal{R}_c}{(AR_{r_c,h,t}^{OFF} + AR_{r_c,h,t}^{ON})} + \sum_{r_v \in \mathcal{R}_v}{AR_{r_v,h,t}} + \sum_{r_b \in \mathcal{R}_b}{AR_{r_b,h,t}} }\label{eq:restotal}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:foottotal}{}{ AF_{h,t}=\sum_{r_c \in \mathcal{R}_c}{AF_{r_c,h,t}^{ON}} + \sum_{r_v \in \mathcal{R}_v}{AF_{r_v,h,t}} + \sum_{r_b \in \mathcal{R}_b}{AF_{r_b,h,t}} }\label{eq:foottotal}\end{equation}

These equations are used to calculate system available reserves and
footroom for all reserve horizons of interest (\(h \in \mathcal{H}\))
across all of the dispatch intervals in a given scenario year
(\(t \in \mathcal{T}\)).

In this study, available reserves and footroom were quantified for NSW
and SA in calendar year 2020 and for two resource mix scenarios in 2025
(see Table~\ref{tbl:scenariodesc}). The 2025 scenarios roughly
correspond to the Central and Step Change scenarios in AEMO's 2020

  this study (i.e.~to 2025), the 2022 ISP broadly reflects the outlook

\end{longtable}

Modelling SA and NSW across these three scenarios enables four
sensitivities to be explored:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Conventional generation retirement}. For NSW, one coal-fired
  power station is retired in 2025 Central and two in 2025 Step Change.
  In SA, four gas-powered steam turbine (Gas-Steam) units and two
  combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) units are retired between 2020 and
  both 2025 scenarios.
\item
  \textbf{Increasing deployment of VRE and BESS}. Additional VRE and
  BESS capacity is deployed in both states between 2020 and 2025 Central
  in AEMO's 2020 ISP. In the 2025 scenarios for both states, a greater
  quantity of VRE (predominantly solar PV) and BESS is installed in the
  Step Change scenario than in the Central scenario. The addition of 2
  GW hydro generation in NSW by 2025 reflects the expansion of the
  region's largest hydro scheme (Snowy 2.0). The capacity mix of each
  state in 2020 and the changes in the mix for each 2025 scenario are
  shown in Figure~\ref{fig:capacities}.
\item
  \textbf{Contrast in resource mix and thus operational constraints}. In
  NSW in 2020, coal-fired generation is a large proportion of the
  generation fleet and is complemented by hydro generation, gas-fired
  generation (CCGTs and OCGTs) and VRE. In SA in 2020, VRE (especially
  wind) is a significant portion of the region's generation fleet. SA's
  synchronous generation consists of gas-fired generation across the
  flexibility spectrum, some of which must remain online to ensure there
  is sufficient system strength in SA for secure operation.
\item
  \textbf{Greater variability in operational demand due to more
  distributed solar PV}. Operational demand is defined as the system
  demand that AEMO dispatches resources to meet (i.e.~excluding demand
  met by DER). As the capacity of distributed solar PV in each region
  increases (i.e.~from 2020 to 2025 Central to 2025 Step Change),
  operational demand in the middle of the day is eroded whilst ramping
  requirements in the morning (downwards) but especially the evening
  (upwards) increase. In other words, higher penetrations of distributed
  solar PV leads to a ``deeper'' duck curve
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020b}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020h}).

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-method}{%
\subsection{Methodology}\label{sec:reserves-method}}

For each region and scenario, the available reserves and footroom in the
system were calculated from the results of a year-long time-sequential
market simulation implemented in the commercial electricity market
modelling tool PLEXOS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-energyexemplarPLEXOSEnergyMarket2021}{Energy
Exemplar, 2021}). The PLEXOS market simulation consisted of a PASA phase
to model maintenance and forced outages for conventional generation
across the year, a Medium Term Schedule phase in NSW to schedule hydro
generation according to monthly energy constraints, and a Short Term
Schedule phase that carries out unit commitment and economic dispatch
(UC-ED) at 5-minute resolution in daily steps\footnote{A 12 hour
  look-ahead was used in the SA model to avoid ``end-of-horizon
  effects''
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-barrowsIEEEReliabilityTest2020}{Barrows et
  al., 2020}), such as end-of-day decommitment of gas-fired generation.}.

Each existing coal-fired (NSW) and Gas-Steam (SA) unit was explicitly
modelled to accurately capture the consequences of partial and full
outages of large capacity units. For other resource types, the
operational constraints and attributes of individual units were averaged
and applied across all units of a resource type. This enabled clustered
UC-ED and thus reduced the computational burden of the Short Term
Schedule phase
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-palmintierHeterogeneousUnitClustering2014}{Palmintier
and Webster, 2014}). For baseload conventional generation and gas
turbines, ramp rates in each direction were separated into a
\emph{market} ramp rate, which was used in the PLEXOS market simulation,
and an \emph{upper} ramp rate, which was used to calculate available
reserves/footroom (Section~\ref{sec:reserves-conventionalcalc}). A lower
magnitude ramp rate in the market simulation (\emph{market}) reflects
participants' preferences to reduce cycling wear-and-tear due to
demanding ramping during typical operation (especially for ageing
assets) (\protect\hyperlink{ref-kumarPowerPlantCycling2012}{Kumar et
al., 2012}), whilst using a higher magnitude ramp rate to calculate a
resource's available reserves and footroom (\emph{upper}) ensures that
the total available flexibility of a resource can be utilised if needed
in a system emergency.

Both NSW and SA were modelled assuming a copper-plate network with no
interconnection to other regions (i.e.~single bus with no network
constraints). The Short Term Schedule mixed-integer linear program was
solved using the CPLEX Optimizer
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-ibmCPLEXOptimizer2021}{IBM, 2021}) with a
relative mixed-integer program gap tolerance of 0.07\%. The generation
and synchronisation status of each resource was obtained from the
solution and used to calculate the available reserves and footroom for
each 5-minute interval using the equations outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:reserves-modeloverview}. A process flow diagram of the
study methodology is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:method_diagram}.

In Appendix A, we outline our sources for key input data and assumptions
(top row of Figure~\ref{fig:method_diagram}) and provide further details
regarding how these data were used in the market simulation and/or the
calculation of available reserves and footroom.

\hypertarget{limitations-1}{%
\subsection{Limitations}\label{limitations-1}}

There are two important caveats to this study. The first is that this
study models each region in isolation -- that is, resources in other NEM
regions can neither assist in meeting demand nor provide available
reserves or footroom through cross-regional interconnectors. During
typical operating conditions, it is likely that any headroom/footroom on
interconnectors would mean that a greater quantity of reserves/footroom
are available to a region, albeit at different horizons due to modified
dispatch patterns. For example, the inclusion of interconnectors in the
SA model between SA and VIC and SA and NSW\footnote{At the time of
  writing, the interconnector between SA and NSW is under construction
  and due to commence operation in 2025/2026
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-electranettransgridProjectEnergyConnect}{ElectraNet,
  Transgrid, n.d.}).} may increase the total available reserves/footroom
in SA at the cost of a decrease in the reserves/footroom available
within shorter horizons. This could arise from local mid-merit gas
generators remaining offline in favour of inflexible but cheaper
coal-fired generation in NSW and VIC.

However, modelling available reserves and footroom for isolated regions
may provide a closer approximation to reality when balancing flexibility
is scarce in a region. Under these circumstances, it is likely that
interconnector flows will already be close to their limits. This will
reduce or altogether prevent the available reserves/footroom provision
from resources in neighbouring regions. Moreover, large interconnector
flows may be prevented if there is a credible risk of regional
separation (loss of synchronism between market regions due to
interconnector circuit faults --- a particular risk in the NEM due to
limited interconnection between market regions); at present, AEMO
co-optimises interconnector flow with regional FCAS procurement
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorConstraintFormulationGuidelines2010}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2010}). An additional consideration is that if
an operating reserve product is implemented to improve the NEM's
resilience to supply-demand shocks, regional procurement requirements
may also limit the available reserves/footroom that can be procured over
an interconnector. As such, the modelling of isolated regions may
approximate actual operation when reserves/footroom are scarce and thus
most valuable to the system.

The second caveat is that this study does not explicitly model FCAS
procurement. If headroom or footroom reserved for FCAS is unable to also
provide available reserves or footroom\footnote{Exclusive headroom
  procurement for an operating reserve service (i.e.~inability to offer
  the same headroom in FCAS markets) is currently being considered
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021}{Energy
  Security Board, 2021}).}, then modelling FCAS markets would reduce the
reserves and footroom that are available within horizons less than or
equal to 5 minutes. However, the actual headroom/footroom reduction
would depend upon the following factors:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Whether regional FCAS procurement constraints bind for the modelled
  region. If they do not, multi-regional or NEM-wide FCAS requirements
  can be satisfied by procuring FCAS in other market regions.
\item
  The degree to which headroom/footroom is ``re-offered'' across
  sequential FCAS markets. For example, a single resource enabled for 10
  MW across the three raise contingency FCAS markets would withdraw less
  system headroom than three resources enabled for 10 MW each for a
  particular FCAS market.
\item
  Headroom that is offered into the 6 second and 60 second raise
  contingency FCAS market may not reflect sustained power provision. For
  example, frequency response from a steam-powered turbine may draw on
  steam stored in a boiler; a sustained response would require a longer
  timeframe due to slower boiler dynamics.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{synthetic-daily-profiles}{%
\subsubsection{Synthetic daily
profiles}\label{synthetic-daily-profiles}}

\emph{Synthetic daily profiles} (SDPs) were developed to quantify the
time-varying spectrum of available reserves and footroom for each
scenario. For a given horizon, the SDP value at a particular time is an
aggregate value (mean or a specific percentile) calculated from the
reserves/footroom available within that horizon at the end of that
dispatch interval across all days in the simulated year. In other words,
values from across the year for a given time of day are aggregated, and
these are then ``stitched'' together to form a ``synthetic day'' curve
for a particular horizon. Two aggregate values were calculated for each
horizon curve:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The mean. This provides a picture of the average or ``typical''
  availability of reserves and footroom at different times of the day
  for a particular scenario year; and
\item
  The bottom 1\% (i.e.~1\textsuperscript{st} percentile or 1-in-100 day
  lowest). This measure better reflects the availability of reserves and
  footroom when they are scarce and thus when they are most
  needed\footnote{More extreme percentiles (i.e.~\textless{} 1\%) could
    better reflect the tight reliability standards adopted in many power
    systems - e.g.~the NEM standard of a maximum expected unserved
    energy of 0.002\% of the total energy demand of a NEM region in an
    Australian financial year
    (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketcommissionreliabilitypanel2022ReviewReliability2022}{Australian
    Energy Market Commission Reliability Panel, 2022}). However, the use
    of extreme percentiles would be more appropriate with a greater
    number of modelled days (i.e.~several years).}.
\end{enumerate}

In addition to an infinite horizon (which corresponds to the maximum
availability), curves were calculated for 1, 5, 15, 30 and 60 minute
horizons. These horizons encompass the start-up times of hydro and
flexible gas generation, and represent the likely timeframes over which
the proposed operating reserve product will be required to respond.

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-reserveSDPs}{%
\subsubsection{Available reserve synthetic
days}\label{sec:reserves-reserveSDPs}}

Mean and bottom 1\% available reserve SDPs were generated for the NSW
scenarios and for the SA scenarios
(Figures~\ref{fig:nswreserves}, \ref{fig:sareserves}). The mean SDPs
across scenarios suggest that, on average, NSW has more than 2 GW and SA
more than 600 MW of reserves available within 5+ minutes. These levels
of reserves:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Correspond to approximately 15\% and 20\% of peak demand in 2020 in
  NSW and SA, respectively. These 5+ minute ``reserve margins'' (i.e.~5+
  minute reserves as a percentage of peak demand) are comparable to
  lower-end reserve margins anticipated for the summer of 2022 in North
  American jurisdictions
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-northamericanelectricreliabilitycorporation2022SummerReliability2022}{North
  American Electric Reliability Corporation, 2022}).
\item
  Exceed the highest N-1 contingency in 2020 (i.e.~highest LOR2 trigger
  level declared in the last run of Pre-Dispatch PASA prior to delivery
  --- see Section~\ref{sec:reserves-ahead_soint}) by approximately 225\%
  in NSW and 170\% in SA
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-prakashNEMSEER2023}{Prakash, 2023}).
\end{enumerate}

Furthermore, with additional BESS and flexible gas resources expected to
be deployed, the mean 5+ minute reserve margins of both regions are
higher for most parts of the day in the 2025 Step Change scenario.
Though the market simulation relied on perfect foresight (additional
uncertainty may reduce reserve margins), these results suggest that
reasonable quantities of reserves are available in each region within a
5+ minute horizon.

and the two 2025 scenarios (rightmost columns).}\label{fig:sareserves}
}
\end{figure}

Across scenarios, the following trends are apparent in the SDPs:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  From 2020 to the 2025 Step Change scenario, a midday peak in the mean
  available reserves SDPs becomes more pronounced. This can be
  attributed to the increasing displacement of conventional generation
  by lower-cost utility-scale solar PV in dispatch (an outcome observed
  by Hummon et al.
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-hummonFundamentalDriversCost2013}{2013}) and
  Tanoto et al.
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-tanotoImpactHighSolar2021}{2021})) and the
  progressive erosion of daytime operational demand due to higher
  penetrations of distributed solar PV. Particularly in SA, curtailed
  VRE and BESS also contribute to this reserve ``surplus''. BESS in
  particular are often charging during such periods of plentiful supply
  and low prices, and thus are able to offer up to double their active
  power rating as reserve (i.e.~by switching from charging to
  discharging).
\item
  As is particularly clear in the bottom 1\% SDPs for the 2025
  scenarios, the availabilities of different reserve horizons tend to
  converge during periods of lower reserves or ``relative scarcity'',
  which include peak demand events in the morning and evening. The
  convergence may be driven by the retirement of baseload conventional
  generation and higher ramping requirements in the 2025 scenarios
  requiring more flexible, mid-merit resources to be online prior to and
  during these periods.
\end{enumerate}

From this analysis, we can also gain an insight into the supply-side
dynamics of a potential operating reserve product market. The first
trend suggests that as energy transition proceeds, a reserve surplus
during the daytime could suppress the price of an operating reserve
product (a dynamic that is further explored by Frew et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-frewCurtailmentParadoxTransition2021}{2021b})).
Moreover, the convergence of availability across horizons during periods
of ``relative scarcity'' suggests that relatively inflexible but cheaper
resources are being preferentially ramped through dispatch at these
times whilst more flexible but expensive resources are left in reserve.
Since the majority of system headroom during these periods appears to be
available within 5 to 15 minutes, operating reserves would likely be
procured from these more flexible resources regardless of whether the
product requires availability within 5 or 30 minutes. As such, concerns
regarding limited providers of a 5-minute horizon product may also apply
to a 30-minute horizon product during periods of relative scarcity
(noting that several resource types in the NEM are already providing
upwards flexibility within 5 minutes in the NEM, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:raise_delayed_supply}).

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-footroomSDPs}{%
\subsubsection{Available footroom synthetic
days}\label{sec:reserves-footroomSDPs}}

Two types of SDPs were constructed for available footroom: one for
\emph{firm} footroom and the other for total footroom. The former refers
to potential footroom provision from conventional resources and BESS,
whereas the latter also includes footroom that can be provided by
curtailing VRE. Figures~\ref{fig:nswfirmfoot}, \ref{fig:nswfoot} show
mean and bottom 1\% SDPs across NSW scenarios for firm footroom and
total footroom, respectively. From the bottom 1\% SDPs in
Figure~\ref{fig:nswfirmfoot}, it is clear that firm system footroom can
become very low in NSW in 2025 as remaining baseload conventional
generators are driven to operate closer to their MSLs. However, such
concerns could be alleviated if VRE provide footroom
(Figure~\ref{fig:nswfoot}). A similar result was observed for the SA
region.

\begin{figure}
\hypertarget{fig:nswfirmfoot}{%

row) SDPs for available firm footroom (i.e.~footroom provided only by
``firm'' resources: conventional and BESS) in NSW in 2020 (leftmost

columns).}\label{fig:nswfirmfoot}
}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

provided by curtailing VRE) in NSW in 2020 (leftmost column) and the two
2025 scenarios (rightmost columns).}\label{fig:nswfoot}
}
\end{figure}

The available footroom in the system is likely sensitive to extent of
conventional generation retirements. Further retirements may enable
remaining conventional resources to operate at a higher loading, thereby
increasing the available footroom in the system. Regardless, given that
each region appears to suffer a lack of \emph{firm} footroom for several
hours during the day in the 2025 scenarios explored in this case study,
mechanisms for procuring sustained downwards balancing flexibility
should be considered alongside those for procuring sustained upwards
balancing flexibility. One simple option would be to implement an
operating \emph{footroom} product, which, if VRE are permitted to
provide this service, can enable conventional generation to operate
closer to their MSL and thus reduce system operating costs and carbon
emissions
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-nelsonInvestigatingEconomicValue2018}{Nelson et
al., 2018}).

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-stelr}{%
\subsubsection{Short-term energy-limited
reserves}\label{sec:reserves-stelr}}

While the available reserves metric does not consider the duration for
which reserve deployment can be sustained, we can infer whether reserves
are short-term energy-limited (i.e.~with a duration no more than a few
hours) based on their resource type. For this analysis, BESS reserve
power was calculated based on the BESS's state of charge at the end of
each dispatch interval and the requirement to sustain provision for 15
minutes. This duration is consistent with the BESS power and capacity
that is reserved in SA for the possibility of loss of interconnection
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020SystemStrength2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020o}). In addition, the maximum available
price-responsive demand available in each state was added to the
available reserves in each dispatch interval (assuming an emergency
response time of 5 minutes) to gain a better understanding of the
maximum potential contribution of demand response. This corresponded to
\textasciitilde60 MW in SA and \textasciitilde290 MW in NSW, based on
AEMO analysis and forecasts in Australian Energy Market Operator
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020}{2020n}).
Both BESS and DR can be considered to be short-term energy-limited
reserve providers. Though conventional generation fuel constraints (e.g
reservoir schemes and the gas system) were not modelled in this market
simulation, the contribution of conventional resources was separated
into those of thermal and hydro to assess the importance of the energy
constraints on each resource type to available reserves in NSW.

Tables \ref{tab:nsw_stel} and \ref{tab:sa_stel} show the median
percentage across dispatch intervals in a scenario year of available
reserves provided by a resources type for NSW and SA, respectively.
Whilst hydro and thermal resources dominate 5 minute horizon reserve
provision in 2020 in NSW and SA, respectively, short-term energy limited
resources provide a greater proportion of reserves in this horizon in
2025. In particular, the median contribution of BESS to reserves
available within 5 minutes is 16\% for NSW and 40\% for SA in the 2025
Step Change scenario. As the reserve horizon is extended to 30 minutes,
a greater proportion of reserves are provided by conventional resources,
which may be better positioned to sustain a response beyond the
short-term\footnote{In reality, conventional resources are also
  susceptible to fuel constraints, as highlighted by the events
  preceding the 2022 NEM suspension
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorNEMMarketSuspension2022}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2022d}). More sophisticated modelling of
  thermal coal availability, the gas system and hydro schemes, including
  their operation under different climate conditions, would be required
  to better understand the potential duration of available reserve
  provided by conventional generation.}. These results indicate that as
energy transition progresses, a trade-off between reserve deployment
speed and duration develops. This trend reaffirms the value of the
sequential and hierarchical approach to reserve product design and
deployment that has been adopted in many jurisdictions
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-prakashInsightsDesigningEffective2022}{Prakash
et al., 2022}). Moreover, it should be noted that unlike other
mechanisms for procuring balancing flexibility, reserve services and
products can specify duration/energy requirements and thus ensure that
flexibility provision is sustained.

\hypertarget{the-role-of-balancing-products}{%
\subsection{The role of balancing
products}\label{the-role-of-balancing-products}}

It is unclear whether introducing an operating reserve product will
deliver material operational benefits to the NEM in light of the revenue
risks, complexity, and implementation and ongoing costs associated with
a new market. Instead, existing mechanisms may be able to deliver
sufficient upwards flexibility, particularly if they can be augmented:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Market participants with forward market obligations are strongly
  incentivised to offer balancing flexibility to the market. The premium
  payment offered to the seller, along with a strong financial incentive
  to perform during periods of system stress, means that derivatives
  such as cap contracts somewhat resemble pay-for-performance capacity
  remuneration mechanisms\footnote{However, derivatives are financial in
    nature and thus need not be ``backed'' by power system resources
    (i.e.~they are not associated with any physical obligation).}.
  Participants would have further incentive if contracting were made
  mandatory (\protect\hyperlink{ref-maysPrivateRiskSocial2022}{Mays et
  al., 2022}), or if they increasingly resort to contracting to hedge
  pricing volatility that could occur as energy transition progresses
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-devriesMarketSignalsAdequacy2022}{de Vries and
  Sanchez Jimenez, 2022}).
\item
  Market and system information and forecasts (e.g.~the NEM's ahead
  processes) may be critical to ensuring that market participants
  schedule resources to provide flexibility to the system. Future work
  should not only seek to improve their accuracy and their treatment of
  uncertainties, but also to understand how they shape participant
  decision-making and thus which enhancements could provide the most
  value.
\end{enumerate}

However, there remain some operational benefits of additional balancing
products. Nested distribution-level markets and/or real-time market
scheduling of aggregated resources have the potential to better enable
balancing flexibility from DER. However, a key insight from
Section~\ref{sec:reserves-stelr} is that consideration should be given
to the duration of this flexibility. System stress could coincide with
periods in which DER owners wish to use these resources for themselves
(e.g.~a heatwave or if they are exposed to real-time market volatility
to some extent)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-robertsVPPUserResearch2020}{Roberts et al.,
2020}). In contrast, reserve products that specify response durations
could provide the SO with certainty that flexibility is only procured
from resources that are available for a minimum period of time. Any
duration requirements would need to be balanced against the quantity and
diversity of flexibility providers -- primarily to ensure that product
markets are competitive, but also because successive deployment of
several short-term energy limited resources may be sufficient to meet
system balancing needs over the course of a few hours. Furthermore,
sustained footroom products might assist SOs in managing a lack of firm
footroom (Section~\ref{sec:reserves-footroomSDPs}). Typically, energy
prices rise when upwards flexibility is scarce, thereby compensating
providers of upward flexibility. In contrast, downwards flexibility
providers are not strictly compensated through energy pricing, as
oversupply could lead to dispatch curtailing, rather than remunerating
flexible resources. Though this might mean flexible resources avoid
financial losses, it comes at the cost of footroom available to the
system. Accordingly, an ``operating footroom'' product that remunerates
downwards flexibility offers a solution to the tension between dispatch
incentives and the need for system footroom.

\hypertarget{sec:reserves-conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion and policy
implications}\label{sec:reserves-conclusion}}

State-of-the-art resource adequacy assessments are closing the gap
between traditional capacity adequacy assessments, which focus on
capacity reserve margins during peak demand events, and flexibility
adequacy assessments that often model chronological operations
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-stenclikQuantifyingRiskUncertain2021}{Stenclik
et al., 2021}). Yet flexibility adequacy assessments alone do not
necessarily offer a better understanding of \emph{what type} of
balancing flexibility a system has and might need, and \emph{how} best
to make it available to the system. As resource mixes change
dramatically during energy transition, system designers, planners and
operators should quantify balancing flexibility capabilities to gain an
appreciation of the availability of different resource types to inform
operational practice design.

By quantifying balancing flexibility ``margins'' in two sub-systems of
the Australian National Electricity Market
(Section~\ref{sec:reserves-casestudy}), we identify potential balancing
flexibility dynamics and trends in future power systems. Firstly,
systems with high penetrations of distributed and utility-scale solar PV
will likely have reserve ``surpluses'' around the middle of the day and
periods of relative reserve scarcity during morning and evening peak
demand events. In such systems, the periods when reserves are most
valuable do not necessarily correspond to the periods during which it is
most efficient to curtail renewable energy generation (due to oversupply
or to obtain reserves). As such, a key recommendation for policy-makers
is to consider whether reserve product markets are needed to elicit
sufficient balancing flexibility provision during these short periods of
relative scarcity, or whether adjusting energy market settings, forward
market obligations and/or market and system information processes can
achieve this. Understanding the potential benefits of new reserve
product markets is crucial because they can introduce additional costs,
constraints and complexity whilst encroaching upon the functions of
other operational practices. Secondly, our study highlights the
importance of placing a greater emphasis on duration, as resources
touted as essential future balancing flexibility providers (e.g.~battery
energy storage, demand response) may only be able to sustain a response
for at most a few hours. Thirdly, we highlight the need to consider
footroom and the benefits of enabling renewable energy to provide it.
Footroom procurement and response duration specifications are
underappreciated by prevailing market designs, and may be better
addressed by policy-makers either modifying existing or creating new
reserve product specifications.

\section{Resource ramp rates}\label{resource-ramp-rates}}

Separate upwards and downwards ramp rates were modelled for most
resource types. For hydro generation and reciprocating engines, maximum
upwards and downwards ramp rates were sourced from GHD
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-ghd2018AEMOCost2018}{2018}). For other
conventional resources (coal-fired generation, Gas-Steam, CCGT and
OCGT), ramp rates in each direction were further separated into a
\emph{market} ramp rate, which was used in the PLEXOS market simulation,
and an \emph{upper} ramp rate, which was used to calculate available
reserves/footroom. For these resources, the market ramp rate was
calculated using the unit ramp rates used most frequently in NEM
dispatch\footnote{AEMO is currently investigating appropriate regional
  requirements for FCAS, particularly for contingency FCAS in the
  terminal regions of QLD and SA
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020b}{Australian
  Energy Market Operator, 2020h},
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019a}{2019d}).}
in 2020, and the upper ramp rate was calculated using resources' assumed
maximum ramp rates in AEMO's 2020 Inputs and Assumptions workbook (for
an example of a comparison, see Figure~\ref{fig:ramp_rate_comparison})
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020n}). Additional resources in 2025 were
assumed to have the same ramp rate characteristics as newer existing

\hypertarget{unit-commitment-and-cycling-constraints}{%
\section{Unit commitment and cycling
constraints}\label{unit-commitment-and-cycling-constraints}}

Many existing flexible conventional resources (OCGT, reciprocating
engines and hydro generation) submit dispatch inflexibility profiles to
AEMO that contain the resource's time to start up and reach MSL, the MSL
itself, the time required at minimum loading and the time taken to shut
down
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFastStartInflexibilityProfile2021}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2021q}). The most frequently offered fast start
inflexibility profile of a resource in 2020 was obtained using NEMOSIS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018}{Gorman et al., 2018})
and used to calculate its start-up rate, minimum up-time, MSL and
shutdown rate. The minimum down-time for these resources was chosen to
be equal to the minimum up-time.

For the other conventional resources (CCGT, coal-fired generation and
Gas-Steam), minimum up-times, minimum down-times and MSLs were obtained
from AEMO's 2020 Inputs and Assumptions workbook
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020n}) and start-up rates were calculated based
on hot or warm start times (i.e.~depending on the start state of the
resource after being offline for its minimum down-time) obtained from
GHD (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ghd2018AEMOCost2018}{2018}) or Aurecon
Australasia
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-aureconaustralasiaGeneratorTechnicalCost2020}{2020}).
The shut-down rates for these resources were calculated based on actual
shutdowns, or those of similar technology types, observed in AEMO
dispatch data that was obtained using NEMOSIS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018}{Gorman et al., 2018}).

BESS were dispatched by PLEXOS's arbitrage algorithm subject to charging
and discharging efficiencies and maximum and minimum state of charge
constraints that corresponded to those assumed within AEMO's 2020 Inputs
and Assumptions workbook
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020n}). Given an assumed economic lifetime of
10 years
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020n}) and 3000 cycles
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-dasilvalimaLifeCycleAssessment2021}{da Silva
Lima et al., 2021}) for lithium-ion BESS, a constraint of 300 cycles per
year was applied to BESS in each scenario.

\hypertarget{partial-and-forced-outages}{%
\section{Partial and forced outages}\label{partial-and-forced-outages}}

Maintenance rates, forced outage rates (partial and full) and the
corresponding mean time taken to repair were modelled for all
conventional generation and were sourced from AEMO's 2020 Inputs and
Assumptions workbook
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020n}).

\hypertarget{sa-synchronous-generation-requirement}{%
\section{SA synchronous generation
requirement}\label{sa-synchronous-generation-requirement}}

At present, certain combinations of synchronous generators are required
to remain online for power system security in SA. Should ahead processes
indicate that the synchronous generation expected to be online and
dispatched is inadequate to provide sufficient system strength in SA,
AEMO will intervene in the market and direct additional synchronous
generation online (\protect\hyperlink{ref-guReviewSystemStrength2019}{Gu
et al., 2019}). The various sufficient combinations of synchronous
generation in SA are outlined in Australian Energy Market Operator
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorTransferLimitAdvice2022}{2022e}),
with a decrease in requirements/increase in the allowable asynchronous
generation level following the installation of 4 synchronous condensers
(completed in 2021). To model these requirements, a must-run condition
was imposed on 3 CCGT units and 1 Gas-Steam unit in 2020, and on 2 CCGT
units and 1 Gas-Steam unit in the 2025 scenarios. These combinations
reflect a subset of the sufficient combinations outlined in Australian
Energy Market Operator
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperatorTransferLimitAdvice2022}{2022e}).

\hypertarget{hydro-generation-monthly-energy-constraints}{%
\section{Hydro generation monthly energy
constraints}\label{hydro-generation-monthly-energy-constraints}}

Run-of-river hydro generation and pumped hydro storage in NSW were
aggregated and modelled as dispatchable generation with monthly energy
constraints. These monthly energy constraints correspond to the average
monthly inflows for the Snowy scheme (NSW and Australia's largest hydro
scheme) across financial years 2011 to 2018 (obtained from Australian
Energy Market Operator
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020}{2020n})).
Though this model for hydro does not account for the additional
generation that could be extracted from pumped storage, the application
of monthly energy constraints could be interpreted as modelling one
pattern of run-of-river hydro operation and/or enforcing the same
reservoir level at the start and end of each month (and thus at the
start and end of each year). Explicitly modelling reservoir schemes,
inflows for individual hydro generators and pumping opportunities for
pumped hydro storage are likely to improve the accuracy of the
methodology proposed in this work for systems with significant shares of
hydropower capacity.

\hypertarget{demand-and-vre-traces}{%
\section{Demand and VRE traces}\label{demand-and-vre-traces}}

Chronological demand traces at 5-minute resolution were used in the
market simulation. For each region, historical operational demand for
2020 at 5-minute resolution was obtained using NEMOSIS
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018}{Gorman et al., 2018})
and used as the demand trace for the 2020 scenario. AEMO ISP demand
traces were available for each 2025 scenario at half-hourly resolution
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020DraftISP2019a}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019f}); 5-minute resolution demand traces for
each 2025 scenario were produced by scaling 5-minute historical
operational demand by a corresponding half-hourly scaling factor, which
was calculated as the ratio of the ISP scenario's 2025 demand trace to
the ISP scenario's 2020 demand trace.

Half-hourly chronological solar PV and wind capacity factor traces were
obtained from AEMO's ISP database for each 2020 scenario
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020DraftISP2019}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2019g}) and for each 2025 scenario
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020ISPSolar2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020p}). Generation traces were obtained by
multiplying the capacity factor trace of a resource by its nameplate
capacity. Capacities for existing and committed VRE plants were obtained
from AEMO's 2020 Inputs and Assumptions workbook
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020}{Australian
Energy Market Operator, 2020n}) and any additional VRE capacity that was
built out in the 2025 scenarios was assigned to AEMO-designated
Renewable Energy Zones (for which capacity factor traces are available)
based on the ISP's generation capacity outlook. The half-hourly
generation traces for each resource and Renewable Energy Zone in a
region were than aggregated and linearly interpolated for use in the
5-minute resolution market simulation.

\hypertarget{resource-market-offers}{%
\section{Resource market offers}\label{resource-market-offers}}

For all scenarios for a given region, one set of four static
price-quantity pairs were used to represent each resource's offer in the
market simulation. Except for hydro generation, offers were priced
\emph{a priori}. The type of the resource determined how each band was
priced (price bands for each resource type are outlined in
Table~\ref{tbl:resourceoffers}) \footnote{The ramp rate used in dispatch
  by AEMO is the lesser of a telemetered rate or a ramp rate submitted
  in a resource's offer for energy, and was obtained using NEMOSIS
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018}{Gorman et al.,
  2018}).}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For wind and solar PV generators, the entire available forecasted
  energy was offered at the market floor price to ensure preferential
  dispatch of VRE where possible.
\item
  For baseload conventional resources (coal-fired generation and
  Gas-Steam), the first band was priced at or close to the market floor
  price to ensure the resource's MSL would clear the market. The second
  band was priced close to the short-run marginal cost (SRMC) of the
  resource. The SRMC was calculated using the average heat rate, fuel
  price and variable operating and maintenance cost of each resource
  type obtained from Australian Energy Market Operator
  (\protect\hyperlink{ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020}{2020n}).
  The third band was priced at a premium relative to the resource's SRMC
  and the fourth band was offered at the market cap price.
\item
  For peaking generation (OCGT and reciprocating engines), the first
  band was priced close to the SRMC of each resource, which was
  calculated in the same manner as for baseload conventional resources.
  The second and third band were offered at a moderate and higher
  premium relative to the resource's SRMC, respectively. The fourth band
  was offered at the market cap price.
\item
  Hydro generation offers were adjusted iteratively to align the
  proportions of annual generation and average market prices of the NSW
  2020 scenario with those calculated from historical data.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Calibration}

Resource offer quantities were used to calibrate the 2020 simulation
with historical generation patterns in each state. The quantity of
energy in each price band was adjusted in an iterative process of offer
adjustment and market simulation to ensure that the proportion of annual
generation of a particular resource type in the simulated 2020 scenario
was similar to the actual proportion of annual generation for that
resource type in 2020. The combination of offer quantities that produced
the closest proportions were retained and used for each state's 2020 and
2025 scenarios. The results of the calibration for NSW and SA are
outlined in Table~\ref{tbl:nswcalibration} and
Table~\ref{tbl:sacalibration}, respectively.
