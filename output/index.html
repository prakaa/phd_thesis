<h1 class="unnumbered" id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>Massive deployments of solar and wind generation mean that power systems worldwide are beginning to experience high penetrations of variable renewable energy. Given the challenges and opportunities posed by these resources to the effective and efficient balancing of active power supply and demand in power systems, policy-makers are revisiting the design of power system operational practices such as grid codes, system operator processes and, in jurisdictions with wholesale competition, electricity markets.</p>
<p>In this thesis, I explore how policy-makers should design operational practices for balancing electricity markets. Because the design process is complex, contested and contextual, I employ an empirical approach that leverages experience from the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM).</p>
<p>Frequency control services are critical to ensuring that imbalances are quickly addressed. In this thesis, I first explore the features needed in arrangements for procuring frequency control services during energy transition. Through a comprehensive international review and an assessment of the NEM, I offer four insights on designing frequency control arrangements as power systems transition.</p>
<p>Market-based practices should be assessed to determine whether they can deliver the balancing flexibility required during energy transition. As a first step in this assessment, I investigate how balancing flexibility capabilities in scheduling timeframes are changing during energy transition using historical and projected resource mixes for two regions of the NEM. Based on these findings, I recommend that policy-makers examine how existing arrangements can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility provision, and that duration specifications and sustained footroom procurement be considered for reserve products.</p>
<p>Market participants must be willing and able to offer balancing flexibility into wholesale spot markets. As such, I shift to exploring how market knowledge processes and participation rules can be configured to maximise balancing flexibility provision. From an analysis of centralised price forecasts from the NEM, I find that errors in these forecasts are increasing in frequency and severity and, as such, arbitrage revenues can be reduced by 15-60+% should these forecasts be used to guide battery energy storage scheduling. I recommend that policy-makers increase the frequency at which forecasts are published and consider market participation restrictions.</p>

6. The behaviour of a synchronous generator providing PFR and SFR in the absence of other resources with droop control. <span class="math inline">L_0</span> is the initial droop characteristic of the turbine governor. The generator is initially operating at point A with an active power output of <span class="math inline">P_{M0}</span> and synchronous speed <span class="math inline">\omega_0</span>. Following an imbalance event, the system frequency begins to drop as the synchronous generator provides inertial response. The turbine governor then begins to actuate and moves the synchronous generator along the droop characteristic. A new steady-state is reached at point B, where the generator’s active power output is <span class="math inline">P_{M1}</span> and the system frequency (and hence the synchronous speed of the turbine) has decreased to <span class="math inline">\omega_1</span>. This constitutes the provision of PFR. Following this, the generator load controller changes the reference speed setpoint of the governor and thus shifts the droop characteristic to <span class="math inline">L_1</span>. This subsequent control action sustains PFR and returns the system to frequency <span class="math inline">\omega_0</span>. This constitutes the provision of SFR.

10. Active power output of QLD super-critical coal generators (top), SA solar PV farms (middle) and SA wind farms (bottom). The response of an individual generator is denoted by solid lines (obtained from 4-second AEMO SCADA data using NEMOSIS <span class="citation" data-cites="gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018">(<a href="#ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018" role="doc-biblioref">Gorman et al., 2018</a>)</span>). None of these generators are enabled for FCAS. The red dashed line in each frame is the regional frequency as measured by high-speed (1-second) phasor measurement units.<br />

11. Regional phasor measurement unit frequency data and AGC reference frequency data from AEMO’s NSW control centre (obtained using NEMOSIS <span class="citation" data-cites="gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018">(<a href="#ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018" role="doc-biblioref">Gorman et al., 2018</a>)</span>) during the power system event on the 25<sup>th</sup> of August, 2018. Note that the AGC reference frequency deviates in the opposite direction to local frequency in QLD and SA.<br />

12. Events and volume-weighted NEM-wide average quarterly prices for energy, raise regulation FCAS and raise contingency FCAS in the NEM. The entry of new albeit smaller FCAS providers in 2017 was preceded by the retirement of several large thermal generation. Q1 2020 FCAS prices were high due to local procurement in the SA region, which was islanded for approximately two weeks. Note that while average energy prices fell in Q2-Q4 in 2020 to levels previously seen in 2014-2015 (due to lower demand during COVID-19 lockdowns), FCAS prices remained relatively high. Five-minute price and volume data obtained using NEMOSIS <span class="citation" data-cites="gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018">(<a href="#ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018" role="doc-biblioref">Gorman et al., 2018</a>)</span>.<br />

14. Standard deviation of mainland frequency grouped by each day, week, month or quarter from 2009 to 2021. Some initial PFR setting changes were made in late September 2020 and many generators moved to final settings in late October 2020.

15. Q4 2020 global supply curves by resource type for the raise 5 minute contingency FCAS market. Each of the supply curves are truncated to the volumes of 5 minute contingency FCAS procured by AEMO across the NEM in that dispatch interval (NEM-wide mean of ~420 MW for Q4 2020). Providers include conventional steam and hydropower generators, an aluminium smelter, demand response (DR) aggregators, VPPs and BESS. As each supply curve is constructed from the offers of resources across the NEM (i.e. global), they do not reflect dispatch outcomes in the presence of regional constraints. Offer and dispatch data were obtained using NEMOSIS (<span class="citation" data-cites="gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018">Gorman et al.

21. Mean (top row) and bottom 1% (bottom row) SDPs for available total footroom (including footroom that would be provided by curtailing VRE) in NSW in 2020 (leftmost column) and the two 2025 scenarios (rightmost columns).<br />

22. Common logarithm of the daily price spread (where <span class="math inline">p_{max}</span> and <span class="math inline">p_{min}</span> are the maximum and minimum price for any given day, respectively) in all mainland NEM regions (i.e. excluding TAS, which is connected to mainland Australia via a high voltage DC transmission line) from 2012 to the end of 2021. The maximum potential spread (dashed red line) is the difference between the market price cap (revised each Australian financial year) and the fixed market price floor (-1000 AUD/MW/hr). The dashed vertical black line denotes the commencement of 5 minute settlement in the NEM. Price data were obtained using <code>NEMOSIS</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018">(<a href="#ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018" role="doc-biblioref">Gorman et al., 2018</a>)</span>.

23. NEM-wide (i.e. all regions) monthly price forecast error counts binned by error direction and magnitude (excluding -300 AUD/MW/hr <span class="math inline">&lt;</span> errors <span class="math inline">\leq</span> 300 AUD/MW/hr ) for forecasts made up to 24 hours (top, using forecast data from 30MPD and 5MPD), 2 hours (middle, using forecast data from 30MPD and 5MPD) and 15 minutes (bottom, using forecast data from 5MPD) ahead of delivery. The dashed and annotated black lines denote major system events and market changes in the NEM. Pre-dispatch price forecasts data were obtained using <code>NEMSEER</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="prakashNEMSEERPythonPackage2023">(<a href="#ref-prakashNEMSEERPythonPackage2023" role="doc-biblioref">Prakash et al., 2023b</a>)</span>, and actual market price data were obtained using <code>NEMOSIS</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018">(<a href="#ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018" role="doc-biblioref">Gorman et al., 2018</a>)</span>. Errors for each forecasted interval were calculated following the omission of the two 30MPD forecasts that overlap with the 5MPD forecast horizon (refer to the research data for this article for further details and source code). This plot was generated using <code>matplotlib</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007">(<a href="#ref-hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007" role="doc-biblioref">Hunter, 2007</a>)</span>.<br />

24. Demand forecast error plotted against the price forecast error for the NSW region in 2021. Each point in the scatter plot corresponds to errors calculated from the forecasts in the last 5MPD run for each dispatch interval (nominally run 5 minutes prior to delivery, but published between 4.5 minutes and 3 minutes prior to delivery <span class="citation" data-cites="mcardleFileCreationTimes2022">(<a href="#ref-mcardleFileCreationTimes2022" role="doc-biblioref">McArdle, 2022</a>)</span>).

25. File sizes of monthly NEM bid and offer data zipfiles from 2012 to 2022 scraped from AEMO’s monthly data archive <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityDataModel2023">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityDataModel2023" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2023b</a>)</span>. The zipfile for each month consists of a single CSV with one AEMO data table (BIDPEROFFER) that contains quantity bid and offer data (including rebids). As such, zipfile size is a suitable proxy for the size of the underlying data and thus the number of bids, offers and rebids. Two 5MS-related changes were accompanied by spikes in bid and offer data zipfile size. The first is indicated by the blue dashed line, which denotes when MPs were able to start submitting the quantity component of their bids and offers for each 5-minute dispatch interval (rather than each 30 minute interval) for the next trading day. The second, denoted by the purple dashed line, denotes the commencement of 5MS. This plot was generated using <code>matplotlib</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007">(<a href="#ref-hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007" role="doc-biblioref">Hunter, 2007</a>)</span>.<br />

26. Share of all rebids by technology type submitted in June for every year from 2013 to 2021. The number at the top of each column is the total number of rebids made in June of that year. June was selected because it was this month in 2021 that saw the highest occurrence of significant price forecast errors in several NEM regions across a range of ahead times for half-hourly dispatch intervals (see <span class="citation" data-cites="prakashEnergyPriceConvergence2023">Prakash (<a href="#ref-prakashEnergyPriceConvergence2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023a</a>)</span>). OCGT refers to open cycle gas turbines, CCGT refers to combined cycle gas turbines and DR/VPP includes demand response and virtual power plants, the latter of which has predominantly referred to aggregated distributed BESS resources to date. Smelter refers to several existing and now decommissioned aluminium smelters, and steam technologies include resources with both coal-fired and gas-fired boilers. Rebid data were obtained from Nemweb <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorNemwebMarketData2023">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorNemwebMarketData2023" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2023c</a>)</span> using the open-source <code>AEMO Monthly Data Archive Tool</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="prakashAEMOMonthlyData2023">(<a href="#ref-prakashAEMOMonthlyData2023" role="doc-biblioref">Prakash, 2023b</a>)</span>. This plot was generated using <code>matplotlib</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007">(<a href="#ref-hunterMatplotlib2DGraphics2007" role="doc-biblioref">Hunter, 2007</a>)</span>.<br />

27. The study’s scheduling methodologies applied across 10 dispatch intervals (50 minutes). The top of the figure (within the red brace) corresponds to the RHOC simulation methodology. The scheduler optimises successive steps, each with a lookahead horizon length of 3 intervals or 15 minutes, and binds the first action of each step (red horizontal bars) to create a simulated BESS schedule. The bottom of the figure (within the blue brace) corresponds to the perfect foresight methodology. The perfect foresight scheduler optimises a single step that looks over the entire study period to produce a perfect foresight BESS schedule.<br />

28. Final aggregate BESS offers adjusted by resource availability and binned by offer price, and the NEM-wide volume weighted average prices on June 4 2021 and June 4 2023. Note that BESS, like other resources in the NEM, tend to shift capacity to lower price bands during periods of high prices. While BESS capacity was predominantly offered in at 1000+ AUD/MW/hr between high price events in 2021, there was a higher degree of quantity segmentation across 50 AUD/MW/hr+ price bands in 2023 (albeit with higher total offer volumes). Nevertheless, more than half of the aggregate in-market BESS capacity was at times offered into the market for at least 10,000 AUD/MW/hr on June 4 2023. Final offers were obtained and processed using <code>nem-bidding-dashboard</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="gormanNembiddingdashboard2023">(<a href="#ref-gormanNembiddingdashboard2023" role="doc-biblioref">Gorman and Chambers, 2023</a>)</span>. This plot was generated using <code>plotly</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="plotlytechnologiesinc.CollaborativeDataScience2015">(<a href="#ref-plotlytechnologiesinc.CollaborativeDataScience2015" role="doc-biblioref">Plotly Technologies Inc., 2015</a>)</span>.<br />

29. The revenue earned by a 100 MW/100 MWh BESS (scheduled using the <em>Arbitrage</em> formulation) plotted against the energy price in the same dispatch interval. Orange points correspond to dispatch interval decisions made with a lookahead horizon length of 15 hours and blue points correspond to dispatch interval decisions made with a lookahead horizon length of 1 hour. Under ideal operation, the points should form a “tick” shape – more negative prices should lead to greater revenues as the BESS charges, and a higher price should lead to greater revenues as the BESS discharges.<br />

30. VPI (bars with black edges) and VPF (bars with grey edges) for BESS with different storage durations (15 minutes to 4 hours across subfigures from top to bottom), lookahead horizon lengths (5 minutes to 15 hours across the horizontal axis of each subfigure) and optimisation formulations (different coloured bars, all described in <span class="citation" data-cites="tbl:formulations">(<a href="#ref-tbl:formulations" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>tbl:formulations?</strong></a>)</span>). Note that for the BESSs with 5 minute lookahead horizon lengths, the VPI bars are close to zero (i.e. myopic operation dominates lost revenue potential).<br />

31. Cumulative throughput (discharged energy) for BESSs with different storage durations (15 minutes, 1 hour and 4 hours in the subfigures from left to right) and different scheduling lookahead horizon lengths (different coloured lines in each subfigure) in 2021. The dashed red line indicates the end-of-year cumulative throughput of a 100 MWh BESS that is cycled once per day.<br />

32. Ramp rates observed (red) and used in dispatch by AEMO (blue) for a coal-fired unit in NSW in 2020. The green line denotes the ramp rate assumed by AEMO in its 2020 Inputs and Assumptions workbook and the 2020 ISP.<br />

33. Significant price forecast errors (i.e. &gt; 300 AUD/MW/hr, see <span class="citation" data-cites="sec:info-case_study-price_forecast_errors">(<a href="#ref-sec:info-case_study-price_forecast_errors" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>sec:info-case_study-price_forecast_errors?</strong></a>)</span> for a definition of “significant”) as a proportion of all price forecast errors for a given forecast ahead time in NSW in 2021.

<p>Consequently, power systems are currently experiencing or soon expected to experience high instantaneous penetrations of variable renewable energy (VRE), of which solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind generation are the most prevalent forms <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorMaintainingPowerSystem2019 matevosyanFutureInverterBasedResources2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorMaintainingPowerSystem2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019b</a>; <a href="#ref-matevosyanFutureInverterBasedResources2021" role="doc-biblioref">Matevosyan et al., 2021</a>)</span>.

<p>In this thesis, I explore how policy-makers should design operational practices for balancing electricity markets given existing challenges and those posed by growing penetrations of VRE. I do so within the context of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), the power system and electricity market that services ~80% of the country’s electricity consumption <span class="citation" data-cites="departmentofclimatechangeenergytheenvironmentandwaterNationalElectricityMarket2023">(<a href="#ref-departmentofclimatechangeenergytheenvironmentandwaterNationalElectricityMarket2023" role="doc-biblioref">Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="sec:intro-research_gap"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Research gap</h2>
<p>Whilst there is some degree of international consensus on high-level outcomes and the priority areas for designing operational balancing practices for electricity markets with growing penetrations of renewable energy, the multi-layered nature of the design problem, the presence of existing tensions and challenges, and a changing resource mix mean that the design process is complex and contested. Previous literature has emphasised the need for empirical research to identify feasible, flexible and contextually appropriate solutions, even if they may not be optimal. Through empirical studies of aspects of the Australian NEM, this thesis endeavours to address this knowledge gap in the Australian context. It also seeks to provide policy-makers in other jurisdictions with valuable insights drawn from the Australian experience and a framework for approaching the design of operational balancing practices in electricity markets undergoing transition.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="sec:intro-research_framework"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Research framework</h2>
<p>The <strong>research question</strong> of this thesis is outlined below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Given existing design challenges and increasing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources as energy transition proceeds, how should we design operational practices for balancing electricity markets?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I focus on three aspects of this question that are encompassed by the following <strong>research objectives</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>To determine what features are needed in centrally-coordinated arrangements for procuring frequency control services during energy transition.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>To better understand how balancing flexibility capabilities in scheduling timeframes are changing during energy transition, and how these changes might impact the suitability and design of more decentralised operational balancing practices.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>To explore how more decentralised operational balancing practices can be configured to maximise the deployability of balancing flexibility in scheduling timeframes.</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>I attempt to achieve these objectives through the following three <strong>research methods</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Review of academic and industry literature on the design of operational balancing practices from the Australian NEM and other jurisdictions.</li>
<li>Analysis of system and market data from the Australian NEM to provide empirical evidence for techno-economic modelling assumptions and to support the discussion of policy options.</li>
<li>Techno-economic (market) optimisation modelling. This includes the modelling of market regions of the NEM, and of market participation schedules for battery energy storage systems engaged in energy arbitrage.</li>
</ol>
<p>The links between the research question, the research objectives and the research methods are shown in Figure 7 and are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.5" id="structure-of-the-thesis"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Structure of the thesis</h2>
<p>This thesis consists of 7 chapters and 4 appendices.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong> provides relevant context on power systems and power system operation, and an overview of the literature on the desirable outcomes of and challenges associated with designing operational practices in electricity markets with growing penetrations of VRE.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong> outlines the motivating research question, the research objectives and research methods of this thesis in detail.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong> considers the question of how frequency control arrangements should be designed with growing penetrations of VRE. In this chapter, I first provide an overview of typical frequency control arrangements, with a focus on restructured electricity industries in North America and Europe, and the main challenges faced in their design. I then describe the NEM’s frequency control arrangements and the specific challenges posed by increasing penetrations of VRE. Based on an analysis of the performance of the NEM’s frequency control arrangements in responding to these challenges, I conclude this chapter by offering four key insights to policy-makers.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong> focuses on understanding balancing flexibility <em>capabilities</em> available in scheduling timeframes as VRE and storage become a larger part of system resource mixes. In this chapter, I first provide an overview of how balancing flexibility is enabled and procured in the NEM before describing a methodology to quantify available reserves and footroom across deployment horizons for various resource types. I then quantify the available reserves and footroom in two regions of the NEM for existing resource mixes in 2020 and potential resources mixes in 2025, with two scenarios for the latter. From the findings of this case study, I explore the role of reserve products in securing balancing flexibility. <strong>Appendix 8</strong> outlines the sources for key input data and assumptions, and provides further details regarding how these data were used in the analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6</strong> explores how future pricing information and market participant operational strategies affect the <em>deployability</em> of balancing flexibility from energy storage resources. In this chapter, I first summarise market information, participation and clearing processes in the NEM in addition to providing context on grid-scale energy storage resource deployment, operation and market participation to date. Then, in a case study of the NEM, I examine errors in the NEM’s centralised price forecasts, propose a hypothesis to explain increasing divergence and the occurrence of price swings in these forecasts, and subsequently use these same forecasts to schedule a variety of battery energy storage systems for wholesale energy market arbitrage to assess the impact of imperfect foresight on arbitrage revenues. I conclude by discussing changes to market participant scheduling and market design that could maximise the balancing value of resources such as battery energy storage systems. <strong>Appendix 9</strong> presents the mixed-integer linear program formulations used in the storage modelling in Chapter 6, and <strong>Appendix 10</strong> describes the methodology used to model a storage scheduler discounting price forecasts (one of the formulations used in the storage modelling in Chapter 6 and described in Appendix 9).</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 7</strong> concludes the thesis. In this chapter, I summarise the contributions of this thesis and highlight avenues for further work.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix 11</strong> is the Journal of Open Source Software article for <code>NEMSEER</code>, a Python package developed as a part of this thesis to download and handle historical NEM forecast data produced by the Australian Energy Market Operator.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.1" id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In this chapter, I provide relevant context and a brief overview of the literature that tackles the challenge of designing operational practices in electricity markets with growing penetrations of variable renewable energy (VRE).</p>
<p>As I summarise in Section 2.6, this review highlights a role for empirical work that identifies “second-best” and flexible design solutions given the specific context of each power system and jurisdiction. This approach to designing operational balancing practices constitutes a knowledge gap that I aim to address in the Australian context within this thesis (see Section 3, the research framework for this thesis).</p>
<p>The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. Firstly, I provide a brief description of power systems in Section 2.2. Then, in Section 2.3, I present a high-level overview of power system phenomena and practices in operational timeframes, highlight the importance of active power balancing and discuss power system operational paradigms with a focus on restructured electricity markets. Following this, in Section 2.4, I describe existing and emerging balancing practices in operational timeframes and, in Section 2.5, I propose good design outcomes and discuss the challenges involved in operational practice design. Finally, in Section 2.6, I summarise the motivation for the work contained within this thesis.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I use <strong>bold text</strong> to introduce definitions for a (new) term or concept.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="sec:lit_review-power_systems"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Power systems</h2>
<p>Given the welfare and economic benefits associated with electricity access, many countries in the 20<sup>th</sup> century constructed bulk power systems to leverage investment and operational economies of scale. These systems sought to efficiently deliver <strong>active power</strong> (the component of apparent power that does work at a load) to numerous electricity end-users (in the aggregate, system <strong>demand</strong> or <strong>load</strong>) from electricity suppliers (<strong>generators</strong>) across vast distances. A typical power system configuration is presented in Figure 1. Generators supply the system with alternating current (AC) power either through a direct electromagnetic connection or, if they are inverter-based resources (IBRs)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, through a power electronic <strong>inverter</strong> interface that converts the direct current (DC) power produced by the generator to AC power. AC power is then transmitted over long distances through a high voltage transmission system. As transmission lines approach load centres, voltages are stepped down to make power delivery to the majority of end-users connected to the lower voltage distribution system safer <span class="citation" data-cites="mastersRenewableEfficientElectric2004">(<a href="#ref-mastersRenewableEfficientElectric2004" role="doc-biblioref">Masters, 2004</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.2.1" id="synchronous-and-control-areas"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Synchronous and control areas</h3>
<p>A network area that is operated at a (constant) nominal AC frequency is known as a <strong>synchronous area</strong>. During normal operation, AC frequency should be close to the system’s nominal value (see Section 2.3.2.1 as to why) and more or less uniform across the synchronous area. A <strong>control area</strong>, on the other hand, is a network area which a particular <strong>system operator</strong> (SO) is responsible for operating. In this thesis, I use the term <strong>jurisdiction</strong> interchangeably with control area, with a preference for the former when referring to a control area with a wholesale electricity market overlay.</p>
<p>Whether the term “power system” refers to a synchronous area or a control area is dependent on context and the relationship between the two in the jurisdiction in question. In eastern and southern Australia, the National Electricity Market’s (NEM) single control area consists of two synchronous areas (see Section 4.5 for further detail). In contrast, other jurisdictions have a single synchronous area composed of several electrically-connected control areas demarcated by political, rather than physical boundaries. For example, continental Europe is a single synchronous area consisting of many national or trans-national control areas, and the continental United States has three synchronous areas (two of which extend into Canada) with over 60 control areas <span class="citation" data-cites="schittekatteDistributedEnergyResources2022 northamericanelectricreliabilitycorporationNERCInterconnections2023">(<a href="#ref-northamericanelectricreliabilitycorporationNERCInterconnections2023" role="doc-biblioref">North American Electric Reliability Corporation, 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-schittekatteDistributedEnergyResources2022" role="doc-biblioref">Schittekatte and Pototschnig, 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.3" id="sec:lit_review-operations"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Power system operations</h2>
<p>Operating a power system involves the direction or control of <strong>power system resources</strong> – generators, loads, network elements and energy storage resources. In most cases, power system operation is an economic optimisation problem that aims to minimise system costs (or under some market paradigms, maximise the value of trade) whilst 1) continuously maintaining a balance between active power supply and demand and 2) ensuring that system resources and the system itself are operated within their respective technical envelopes <span class="citation" data-cites="woodPowerGenerationOperation2014">(<a href="#ref-woodPowerGenerationOperation2014" role="doc-biblioref">Wood et al., 2014</a>)</span>. The former constraint more or less corresponds to <strong>reliable</strong> operation<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and the latter implies <strong>secure</strong> (or <strong>stable</strong>) operation and is a prerequisite for reliable operation <span class="citation" data-cites="anderssonPowerSystemSecurity2021">(<a href="#ref-anderssonPowerSystemSecurity2021" role="doc-biblioref">Andersson, 2021</a>)</span>.

<h3 data-number="4.3.2" id="sec:lit_review-balancing"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Active power balancing</h3>
<p><strong>Active power balancing</strong> can be described in simple terms using the law of conservation of energy: the energy supplied into a network node through primary energy conversion, energy storage or transmission is equal to the sum of the energy dissipated, stored, consumed and transmitted away from the same network node at each and every moment. A more practical definition that encompasses the key concerns of power system engineers is that active power balancing requires <em>real-time</em> control of generation and loads to balance active power supply and demand <em>across the power system</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Real-time</em> (i.e. moment-to-moment) control of supply and demand is required because it is still uneconomical in many jurisdictions to store electricity at scale despite grid-scale storage cost reductions <span class="citation" data-cites="internationalenergyagencyGridScaleStorage2022">(<a href="#ref-internationalenergyagencyGridScaleStorage2022" role="doc-biblioref">International Energy Agency, 2022</a>)</span>. In other words, many power systems have small balancing buffers and thus require real-time balancing.</li>
<li>Whilst electricity can be transported close to the speed to light across a synchronous area, some degree of balancing coordination <em>across the power system</em> is required because of transmission losses and constraints on network flows imposed by line thermal limits, stability requirements and Kirchoff’s circuit laws <span class="citation" data-cites="kirschenFundamentalsPowerSystem2004 hirthWhyWindNot2016a">(<a href="#ref-hirthWhyWindNot2016a" role="doc-biblioref">Hirth et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-kirschenFundamentalsPowerSystem2004" role="doc-biblioref">Kirschen and Strbac, 2004</a>)</span>. A whole-of-system approach is also necessary because active power imbalances in network sub-regions can have system-wide consequences (see Section 2.3.2.1).</li>

<p>Unlike many other commodity transportation networks, an active power supply-demand imbalance can lead to deviations in technical parameters – voltage and AC frequency – that not only have the potential to damage equipment connected to the power system, but also to trigger a system collapse (see Section 2.3.2.1.2) <span class="citation" data-cites="borensteinEconomicsElectricityReliability2023">(<a href="#ref-borensteinEconomicsElectricityReliability2023" role="doc-biblioref">Borenstein et al., 2023</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Equation 1 describes an important characteristic of synchronous machines during stable operation, but the link between active power balance and power system frequency requires examining synchronous machine <em>dynamics</em>. As shown in Figure 3, the interaction between the magnetic fields of the rotor and stator of a synchronous generator (e.g. coal-fired, gas-fired and hydro generation) produces an electromagnetic torque (<span class="math inline">T_e</span>) on the rotor that opposes the mechanical torque (<span class="math inline">T_m</span>) supplied by a prime mover (e.g. steam turbine). Equation 2, which is a variation of what is known as the swing equation, is an energy balance across the synchronous generator. It shows that if there is a transient increase in the electrical load of the power system (equivalent to an increase in <span class="math inline">P_e</span> and thus <span class="math inline">T_e</span>), the rotor of a synchronous generator will begin to decelerate as its stored kinetic energy is converted to electrical energy <span class="citation" data-cites="graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994 elgerdElectricEnergySystems1971">(<a href="#ref-elgerdElectricEnergySystems1971" role="doc-biblioref">Elgerd, 1971</a>; <a href="#ref-graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994" role="doc-biblioref">Grainger, 1994</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The relationship between the active power imbalance in a power system (<span class="math inline">P_{gen}-P_{load}</span>) and AC frequency is obtained by extending the swing equation from a single synchronous generator to all synchronous generators in a synchronous area (Equation 3). Equation 3 shows that the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) is proportional to the active power imbalance and inversely proportional to the system’s inertia constant, <span class="math inline">H</span>. This form of the swing equation only models the <strong>inertial response</strong> of synchronous generators; that is, it does not include the load damping response offered by (frequency-dependent) induction motor loads. The generation inertia constant is often used as a proxy for the system inertia constant since the high speed and mass of generator rotors mean that they store significant quantities of kinetic energy <span class="citation" data-cites="ulbigImpactLowRotational2014 denholmInertiaPowerGrid2020">(<a href="#ref-denholmInertiaPowerGrid2020" role="doc-biblioref">Denholm et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-ulbigImpactLowRotational2014" role="doc-biblioref">Ulbig et al., 2014</a>)</span>.</p>

For these reasons, frequency-sensitive relays are often used to protect power system resources from frequency excursions.</p>
<p>However, these same equipment protection measures can also trigger the complete collapse of the power system. Should the disconnection of a resource following a relay trip exacerbate an existing active power imbalance, the system frequency may deviate further and result in further disconnections. Situations such as these are known as <strong>cascading failures</strong> and can lead to the collapse of the entire power system. As such, SOs often employ emergency frequency control schemes to arrest imbalances by tripping loads in the event of under-frequency (under-frequency load shedding or <strong>UFLS</strong>) or generation in the event of over-frequency (over-frequency generation shedding or <strong>OFGS</strong>) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021 hartmannEffectsDecreasingSynchronous2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021a</a>; <a href="#ref-hartmannEffectsDecreasingSynchronous2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hartmann et al., 2019</a>)</span>.

<p>Though governance and operational arrangements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the powers, responsibilities and degree of ring-fencing imposed upon the SO are largely dictated by one of two possible operational paradigms for a control area <span class="citation" data-cites="chawlaGlobalTrendsElectricity2013">(<a href="#ref-chawlaGlobalTrendsElectricity2013" role="doc-biblioref">Chawla and Pollitt, 2013</a>)</span>: where the SO is a <strong>vertically-integrated utility</strong>, and where the SO is, at the very least, responsible for operating a transmission system that forms the physical basis of a <strong>wholesale electricity market</strong>.

<h4 data-number="4.3.3.1" id="vertically-integrated-utility"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.1</span> Vertically-integrated utility</h4>
<p>Under this paradigm, a single company (either state-owned or privately-owned but regulated) owns, operates and invests in generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as being responsible for the retail of electricity to the end-user. This was the sole operational paradigm for much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Having a single owner and operator of power system resources reduces complexity and transaction costs, and enables economies of scale in both asset investment (particularly generation infrastructure) and operation <span class="citation" data-cites="sioshansiElectricityMarketReform2006">(<a href="#ref-sioshansiElectricityMarketReform2006" role="doc-biblioref">Sioshansi, 2006</a>)</span>. The benefits from economies of scale are material where industrialisation and/or electrification are driving sustained load growth.

<h4 data-number="4.3.3.2" id="wholesale-electricity-markets"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.2</span> Wholesale electricity markets</h4>
<p>Beginning in the late 1980s, some jurisdictions opted to <strong>restructure</strong> their electricity sector. To varying degrees across different jurisdictions, the impetuses for restructuring included advancements in small low-upfront cost gas turbine technologies, the promise of consumer choice, perceptions that vertically-integrated utilities were inefficient and politicised, and a political zeitgeist prevalent at the time that pursued economic efficiency through privatisation and competition <span class="citation" data-cites="sioshansiElectricityMarketReform2006 macgillElectricityIndustryReform2013 simshauserLessonsAustraliaNational2019 chesterEnergyProblemRepresentation2019">(<a href="#ref-chesterEnergyProblemRepresentation2019" role="doc-biblioref">Chester and Elliot, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-macgillElectricityIndustryReform2013" role="doc-biblioref">MacGill and Healy, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-simshauserLessonsAustraliaNational2019" role="doc-biblioref">Simshauser, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-sioshansiElectricityMarketReform2006" role="doc-biblioref">Sioshansi, 2006</a>)</span>. Two features common to electricity industry restructuring processes were the unbundling of vertically-integrated utilities and the introduction of competition for wholesale supply (and in some cases, demand) via an <strong>electricity market</strong> – an auction-based mechanism for the sale and/or purchase of electrical energy.</p>
<h5 data-number="4.3.3.2.1" id="unbundling"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3.2.1</span> Unbundling</h5>
<p>In most cases, the unbundling of a vertically-integrated utility divided generation ownership and barred the SO from owning generation assets. In some jurisdictions, SOs retained ownership of the transmission network (e.g. Transmission System Operators, or TSOs, in many European control areas) whereas others made their SOs “independent” by relieving them of any asset ownership (e.g. Independent System Operators in North American control areas). Some SOs, such as those in North America and the Australian NEM, were also given market operation responsibilities <span class="citation" data-cites="chawlaGlobalTrendsElectricity2013">(<a href="#ref-chawlaGlobalTrendsElectricity2013" role="doc-biblioref">Chawla and Pollitt, 2013</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The design and implementation of wholesale electricity markets differs across jurisdictions that undertook electricity industry restructuring. Despite these differences, electricity markets worldwide can broadly be categorised into two markets models<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> that are distinguished by the degree of centralisation in system and market operations <span class="citation" data-cites="barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005 cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017 ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022">(<a href="#ref-ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022" role="doc-biblioref">Ahlqvist et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005" role="doc-biblioref">Barroso et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017" role="doc-biblioref">Cramton, 2017</a>)</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Central dispatch</strong> markets, where decisions regarding dispatch and, in some cases, unit commitment (see Section 2.4.2) are made by the SO. System and market operations are often <strong>integrated</strong> (i.e. the SO is also the market operator) through a <strong>mandatory power pool</strong> in which supply offers are aggregated and cleared against a demand forecast (one-sided pool), or against an aggregated demand curve constructed from potential buyers (two-sided pool) <span class="citation" data-cites="barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005">(<a href="#ref-barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005" role="doc-biblioref">Barroso et al., 2005</a>)</span>. In these markets, locational prices for energy and <strong>ancillary services</strong> (services procured to maintain security and reliability) are produced by SO-run centralised optimisation processes that consider the physical constraints of the transmission system. This market model has been adopted in Independent System Operator/Regional Transmission Operator (ISO/RTO) markets in North America (refer to Section 4.4.2.1 for more detail). As I discuss further in Section 6.4.1, the Australian NEM’s design is predominantly based on this model though it does incorporate some features of more decentralised markets.</p></li>
<li><p>Decentralised or <strong>self-dispatch</strong> markets, where decisions regarding dispatch and unit commitment are made by market participants, and in which system and market operations are more decoupled. These types of markets facilitate trade through bilateral contracts between suppliers and buyers. Whilst scheduling and dispatch is managed by market participants, they are required to submit intended schedules to the SO ahead of delivery (often during the day before delivery). The SO is responsible for taking redispatch actions to ensure that transmission constraints are not violated, and for determining the requirement for and procuring balancing services (another name for frequency control services, which I discuss in greater detail in Section 2.4.1) that maintain system balance following market gate closure. As outlined in Section 4.4.2.2, this is the dominant market model in Europe.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 4 shows the primary and secondary commercial arrangements in each of these market models. A mandatory power pool is the primary exchange mechanism in central dispatch markets, whereas self-dispatch markets are designed to facilitate exchange through bilateral contracts. However, both exchange mechanisms are present in each market model. Bilateral contracts (in the form of derivatives) are often used as hedging instruments in central dispatch markets, and several self-dispatch markets, such as those in Europe, have associated voluntary power exchanges that are essentially power pools <span class="citation" data-cites="barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005">(<a href="#ref-barrosoClassificationElectricityMarket2005" role="doc-biblioref">Barroso et al., 2005</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Power system resource inflexibilities and the desire for physical and financial risk management mechanisms in operational timeframes have driven policy-makers in many jurisdictions to design and implement electricity markets with multiple market <strong>platforms</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="energysecurityboardSystemServicesAhead2020 isemongerBenefitsRisksVirtual2006">(<a href="#ref-energysecurityboardSystemServicesAhead2020" role="doc-biblioref">Energy Security Board, 2020a</a>; <a href="#ref-isemongerBenefitsRisksVirtual2006" role="doc-biblioref">Isemonger, 2006</a>)</span>. Platforms are formal sub-markets for energy (and sometimes ancillary services) that are cleared ahead of the delivery of electricity and/or ancillary services. The number of platforms implemented in a particular market is often related to its market model. Self-dispatch markets can maximise trade and better facilitate market participants balancing their positions by implementing multiple market platforms (typically day-ahead and several intra-day, see Section 4.4.2.2), whereas the number of platforms in central dispatch markets (typically real-time and in most cases, day-ahead) is limited by the computational complexity of the optimisation algorithm(s) used by the SO to clear each market platform (see Section 4.4.2.1 and Section 4.5) <span class="citation" data-cites="ahlqvistCentralSelfDispatchElectricity2018">(<a href="#ref-ahlqvistCentralSelfDispatchElectricity2018" role="doc-biblioref">Ahlqvist et al., 2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>SOs employ <strong>balancing practices</strong> in operational timeframes (including the non-faded processes, services and markets shown in Figure 2) to obtain <strong>balancing flexibility</strong>.

Though the particularities of these practices vary between jurisdictions, they are almost always organised in a hierarchical and sequential fashion to ensure that active power supply and demand are continuously balanced across different timeframes. Furthermore, in jurisdictions that have restructured their electricity industries, balancing practices that were previously administered by a vertically-integrated utility have been adapted into or integrated with market-based mechanisms.</p>
<p>In the subsections that follow, I describe balancing practices in the order of the timescales in which they are relevant. It is important to stress that a particular jurisdiction may formally incorporate only a subset of the practices described below in their operational procedures and market design.</p>

<p>In power systems where scheduling processes are infrequently run (e.g. vertically-integrated utilities that historically produced hourly schedules) or in which a “safety margin” is desired to address active power imbalances that endure over multiple scheduling intervals, tertiary frequency response (TFR) is deployed to relieve PFR and SFR <span class="citation" data-cites="hewickerDimensioningControlReserves2020">(<a href="#ref-hewickerDimensioningControlReserves2020" role="doc-biblioref">Hewicker et al., 2020</a>)</span>.

<h3 data-number="4.4.2" id="sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-scheduling"><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Scheduling</h3>
<p>The purpose of <strong>scheduling</strong> is to produce efficient (or economic) generation and consumption schedules for the minutes to days ahead based on expected power system conditions. In a similar manner to <span class="citation" data-cites="chowElectricityMarketDesign2005">Chow et al. (<a href="#ref-chowElectricityMarketDesign2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>, I divide the scheduling problem into three phases: dispatch, unit commitment and longer-term scheduling.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.4.2.1" id="dispatch"><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.1</span> Dispatch</h4>
<p>Dispatch involves assigning generation or consumption targets to already-committed power system resources in real-time (i.e. several minutes ahead of delivery). Dispatch is carried out by the monopoly utility in vertically-integrated electricity industries, the SO in central dispatch markets and is self-managed by market participants in self-dispatch markets. In the first two cases, the SO dispatches power system resources by running a process known as <strong>security-constrained economic dispatch</strong>. Security-constrained economic dispatch seeks to find a minimum cost operating configuration for committed generation and loads such that a short-term forecast of non-scheduled demand can be met subject to network constraints and stability and reliability requirements<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994">(<a href="#ref-graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994" role="doc-biblioref">Grainger, 1994</a>)</span>. Some SOs solve this problem for a single interval (e.g. in the Australian NEM), whereas others, including the California and Midcontinent ISOs, solve a multi-period dispatch to procure and, to some extent, price capabilities to address expected non-scheduled demand ramps <span class="citation" data-cites="schiroProcurementPricingRamping2017 elaSchedulingPricingExpected2016">(<a href="#ref-elaSchedulingPricingExpected2016" role="doc-biblioref">Ela and O’Malley, 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-schiroProcurementPricingRamping2017" role="doc-biblioref">Schiro, 2017</a>)</span>. The dispatch solution for each dispatch interval (typically 5–15 minutes long) consists of generation and consumption setpoints, enablement quantities for resources providing frequency control services and, in central dispatch markets that integrate power system and market operation, real-time market locational marginal prices for energy and ancillary services <span class="citation" data-cites="cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017">(<a href="#ref-cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017" role="doc-biblioref">Cramton, 2017</a>)</span>.

<h4 data-number="4.4.2.2" id="sec:lit_review-balancing_practices-scheduling-uc"><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.2</span> Unit commitment</h4>
<p>Thermal and hydroelectric generation, which historically dominated supply in many power systems, have inflexibility constraints (minimum load, start-up time, ramping limits and minimum up and down times) and costs (those attached to resource start-up, shut-down and operation at minimum load) that require SOs and market participants to make non-trivial <strong>unit commitment</strong> decisions (i.e. whether a resource should be online or offline). Depending on the resource, these decisions are made several minutes to hours ahead of power delivery <span class="citation" data-cites="denholmHowLowCan2018 agoraenergiewendeFlexibilityThermalPower2017">(<a href="#ref-agoraenergiewendeFlexibilityThermalPower2017" role="doc-biblioref">Agora Energiewende, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-denholmHowLowCan2018" role="doc-biblioref">Denholm et al., 2018</a>)</span>. Unit commitment is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managed by vertically-integrated utilities for all resources in jurisdictions that have not undergone restructuring;</li>
<li>Built into the day-ahead market and intra-day reliability processes in central dispatch markets; and</li>
<li>Self-managed by market participants in self-dispatch markets and in single-platform semi-centralised markets such as the Australian NEM.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first two cases, the SO runs a process known as <strong>security-constrained unit commitment</strong>, which seeks to determine the minimum cost subset of power system resources that should be committed to meet a non-scheduled demand forecast for a future horizon (usually 36–48 hours ahead) subject to network constraints and stability and reliability requirements. Security-constrained unit commitment is usually formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. Solving mixed-integer programs is computationally complex due to the non-convexity of the integral solution space <span class="citation" data-cites="woodPowerGenerationOperation2014 knuevenMixedintegerProgrammingFormulations2020">(<a href="#ref-knuevenMixedintegerProgrammingFormulations2020" role="doc-biblioref">Knueven et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-woodPowerGenerationOperation2014" role="doc-biblioref">Wood et al., 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the day-ahead platforms of central dispatch markets, market participants submit start-up and minimum load costs in addition to a piecewise linear offer for energy <span class="citation" data-cites="herreroEvolvingBiddingFormats2020">(<a href="#ref-herreroEvolvingBiddingFormats2020" role="doc-biblioref">Herrero et al., 2020</a>)</span>. The SO then solves a security-constrained unit commitment problem to clear the day-ahead market. This produces locational prices for energy and ancillary services for each market interval in the day-ahead horizon (usually each hour) and an ahead schedule <span class="citation" data-cites="isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009 cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017">(<a href="#ref-cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017" role="doc-biblioref">Cramton, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009" role="doc-biblioref">Isemonger, 2009</a>)</span>. The ahead schedule is typically only financially binding; that is, any real-time deviations from this schedule are settled using real-time market prices. As discussed in Section 2.3.3.2.3, the day-ahead market platform provides market participants with an opportunity to hedge their real-time market position, and gives both market participants and the SO greater certainty of resource schedules before power delivery.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.4.2.3" id="longer-term-scheduling"><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2.3</span> Longer-term scheduling</h4>
<p>Operational planning actions taken in longer-term scheduling timeframes (i.e. a day to years ahead) include resource maintenance scheduling, the management of energy/fuel reserves and ensuring that any social and environmental obligations placed on resources are met (e.g. regulated discharges from hydroelectric scheme dams). Many of these activities are conducted on the basis of information supplied by longer-term weather/climate, power system and market forecasts <span class="citation" data-cites="helistoIncludingOperationalAspects2019 sucklingSeasonaltoDecadalClimateForecasting2018 denholmHowLowCan2018">(<a href="#ref-denholmHowLowCan2018" role="doc-biblioref">Denholm et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-helistoIncludingOperationalAspects2019" role="doc-biblioref">Helistö et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-sucklingSeasonaltoDecadalClimateForecasting2018" role="doc-biblioref">Suckling, 2018</a>)</span>.

<h2 data-number="4.5" id="sec:lit_review-design"><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Designing balancing practices in operational timeframes</h2>
<p>Energy transition has prompted policy-makers worldwide to revisit and redesign existing balancing practices in their jurisdictions. There is some degree of international consensus surrounding desirable high-level design outcomes (Section 2.5.1) and a suite of changes that could assist with accommodating greater shares of VRE. I describe these changes in Section 4.4.3.1 and Section 5.3, but they most notably include enabling greater demand-side participation, making electricity markets faster and more flexible, and acquiring more balancing flexibility by modifying existing reserve products and introducing new ones <span class="citation" data-cites="papaefthymiou100RenewableEnergy2016 holttinenDesignOperationEnergy2021 rieszDesigningElectricityMarkets2015">(<a href="#ref-holttinenDesignOperationEnergy2021" role="doc-biblioref">Holttinen et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-papaefthymiou100RenewableEnergy2016" role="doc-biblioref">Papaefthymiou and Dragoon, 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-rieszDesigningElectricityMarkets2015" role="doc-biblioref">Riesz and Milligan, 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, various barriers and complexities pose challenges to the design and implementation of such mechanisms and contribute to the contested nature of the design process <span class="citation" data-cites="papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018 silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022 schittekatteFlexibilityMarketsProject2020 macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020">(<a href="#ref-macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020" role="doc-biblioref">MacGill and Esplin, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018" role="doc-biblioref">Papaefthymiou et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-schittekatteFlexibilityMarketsProject2020" role="doc-biblioref">Schittekatte and Meeus, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022" role="doc-biblioref">Silva-Rodriguez et al., 2022</a>)</span>.

<h3 data-number="4.5.1" id="sec:lit_review-design_outcomes"><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1</span> Outcomes of good design</h3>
<p>Below, I present three desirable outcomes of the design process that I use to assess changes to balancing practices throughout this thesis. All three have been previously discussed in the literature and in a co-authored submission to an Australian NEM reform process <span class="citation" data-cites="macgillResponseEnergySecurity2020">(<a href="#ref-macgillResponseEnergySecurity2020" role="doc-biblioref">MacGill et al., 2020b</a>)</span>. As I discuss further in Section 4.4.3 and Section 5.3, in practice there are trade-offs that mean that an improvement in one outcome may come at the expense of another.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Effectiveness</strong>. Effective balancing practices procure balancing flexibility that is sufficient, in terms of both quantity and performance, to ensure that power system balancing requirements are met. I extend effectiveness to also include the robustness of balancing practices to the wide range of future operating conditions and system configurations that may arise as energy transition proceeds <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021 prakashResponseFrequencyControl2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021a</a>; <a href="#ref-prakashResponseFrequencyControl2021" role="doc-biblioref">Prakash et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong>. Efficient balancing practices procure balancing flexibility at the lowest cost to the system, both now (<strong>productive efficiency</strong>) and into the future (<strong>dynamic efficiency</strong>). Furthermore, efficient arrangements should also procure the right mix of balancing flexibility according to balancing requirements determined by user and/or system needs (<strong>allocative efficiency</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimising administrative costs and complexity</strong>. Administrative costs, such as those associated with operating a market for procuring balancing flexibility or with verifying its delivery, can be significant. Administrative costs include expenses related to metering equipment, IT systems and additional staff. Complex administrative arrangements can be problematic as they may hamper effective balancing flexibility delivery and/or interact with other power system processes in ways that are unforeseen and unintended.</p></li>

<p>Many jurisdictions are presently experiencing or are soon expected to experience high instantaneous penetrations of VRE resources and IBRs <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorMaintainingPowerSystem2019 matevosyanFutureInverterBasedResources2021 elaElectricityMarketFuture2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorMaintainingPowerSystem2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019b</a>; <a href="#ref-elaElectricityMarketFuture2021" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-matevosyanFutureInverterBasedResources2021" role="doc-biblioref">Matevosyan et al., 2021</a>)</span>. VRE resources pose challenges to power system balancing as they introduce additional variability and uncertainty, and because IBRs do not provide an inherent or controlled response to frequency deviations unless they are explicitly configured to do so. I elaborate on these challenges in Section 4.3, Section 4.4.3.1 and Section 5.3. These challenges are of greater concern to islanded power systems and weakly-interconnected control areas that have limited to no access to a wider synchronous area for balancing assistance <span class="citation" data-cites="hodgeAddressingTechnicalChallenges2020">(<a href="#ref-hodgeAddressingTechnicalChallenges2020" role="doc-biblioref">Hodge et al., 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.5.2.2" id="the-tension-between-effectiveness-and-efficiency"><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2.2</span> The tension between effectiveness and efficiency</h4>
<p>The tension between effectiveness, the primary objective of engineering standards and practices, and efficiency, an outcome championed by economists and often pursued through markets, significantly contributes to the complexity and contested nature of the design process in restructured electricity industries. One perspective of this tension which I present in Section 4.3, Section 5.3 and is extensively discussed by <span class="citation" data-cites="chaoInterfaceEngineeringMarket2005">Chao et al. (<a href="#ref-chaoInterfaceEngineeringMarket2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>) is that the efficiency gains obtained through market-based mechanisms for procuring balancing flexibility may come at the expense of the redundancy, certainty and control that a SO might require to guarantee effective balancing. An alternative perspective of this tension is that restructuring enables market participants to scrutinise and lobby for changes to operational practices that adhere to engineering best-practice regardless of the costs of doing so. In other words, market participants can help achieve efficient operation through advocacy “because choices of operating standards can severely impact their profits”, especially in the case of practices associated with “costs that the [SO] passes to participants via grid management charges” <span class="citation" data-cites="chaoInterfaceEngineeringMarket2005">(<a href="#ref-chaoInterfaceEngineeringMarket2005" role="doc-biblioref">Chao et al., 2005, p. 1984</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The tension between effectiveness and efficiency can be reframed as the problem of specifying the degree to which balancing flexibility procurement arrangements are <em>centralised</em> (i.e. managed by the SO). The SO is best placed to manage the procurement of specialised and system-critical frequency control services, whereas the provision of some forms of balancing flexibility in scheduling timeframes can largely be left to market participants to self-manage. I use this problem framing when outlining the research objectives of this thesis in Chapter 3.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.5.2.3" id="sec:lit_review-design-challenges-secondbest"><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2.3</span> The requirement for “second-best” design</h4>
<p>Perspectives from both engineering and economics have been invoked in the electricity market design literature when referring to the “second-best” design challenge. <span class="citation" data-cites="macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020">MacGill and Esplin (<a href="#ref-macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> approach the market design problem with a systems engineering perspective guided by the principle of sub-optimisation, which holds that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optimizing each subsystem independently will not in general lead to a system optimum, or more strongly, improvement of a particular subsystem may actually worsen the overall system <span class="citation" data-cites="machol1965system">(<a href="#ref-machol1965system" role="doc-biblioref">Machol, 1965</a>)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there is introduced into a general equilibrium system a constraint which prevents the attainment of one of the Paretian conditions, the other Paretian conditions, although still attainable, are, in general, no longer desirable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, if a constraint imposed by technical, social or political factors (some of these are referred to as “market distortions” in the literature) or by the construct of the market itself (discussed later in this subsection) prevents some conditions and/or features that are necessary for an efficient outcome, then 1) pursuing the other conditions and/or features required by that design does not guarantee an improvement in system welfare (it may, in some cases, even worsen it) and 2) imposing other “market distortions” (often regulatory mechanisms) on the system may actually improve welfare outcomes. For example, “the adoption of a free trade policy by one country, in a multi-country tariff ridden world, may actually lower the real income of that country and of the world” <span class="citation" data-cites="lipseyGeneralTheorySecond1956">(<a href="#ref-lipseyGeneralTheorySecond1956" role="doc-biblioref">Lipsey and Lancaster, 1956, p. 14</a>)</span>.</p>

This cost asymmetry suggests that there are externalities tied to security and reliability (security-of-supply) that are not reflected in the price of balancing processes, services and products <span class="citation" data-cites="macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020 kepplerWhySustainableProvision2022">(<a href="#ref-kepplerWhySustainableProvision2022" role="doc-biblioref">Keppler et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020" role="doc-biblioref">MacGill and Esplin, 2020</a>)</span>. As suggested by R. H. Coase’s analysis of the problem of “social cost”, there exists a bargaining solution for addressing security-of-supply externalities in the form of <strong>differentiated reliability</strong> (i.e. consumers of electricity pay for different levels of service) <span class="citation" data-cites="billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020 maysPrivateRiskSocial2022">(<a href="#ref-billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020" role="doc-biblioref">Billimoria et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-maysPrivateRiskSocial2022" role="doc-biblioref">Mays et al., 2022</a>)</span>; however, the issue of equitable access to an essential service and the significant transaction costs<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> associated with this solution have led to the characterisation of security-of-supply as a public good and the allocation of responsibility for reliability to the SO <span class="citation" data-cites="coaseProblemSocialCost1960">(<a href="#ref-coaseProblemSocialCost1960" role="doc-biblioref">Coase, 1960</a>)</span>. The ultimate outcome here is that the effective provision of the public good (i.e. meeting a system-wide requirement for reliability) requires “distortions” in the markets for the products and services that are required to provide it <span class="citation" data-cites="maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021">(<a href="#ref-maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021" role="doc-biblioref">Mays, 2021</a>)</span>. For example, many markets for frequency control services are monopsonistic; the SO is the sole buyer and controls market demand, albeit on behalf of the system to ensure that sufficient capabilities are procured for secure and reliable operation <span class="citation" data-cites="reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007">(<a href="#ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007" role="doc-biblioref">Y. Rebours et al., 2007</a>)</span>. I discuss the role of other “distortions” and market incompleteness in hindering efficient price formation and cost allocation in Australian frequency control markets in Section 4.</p>
<p>Secondly, because unbundled SOs have neither direct control nor ownership of generation or demand-side resources, policy-makers in restructured jurisdictions are constrained in the design problem because SOs must <em>procure</em> rather than provide balancing flexibility. In the absence of ownership restrictions, it might be more effective and/or efficient for the SO itself to provide balancing flexibility. Referring to ancillary services (of which frequency control services are a subset), <span class="citation" data-cites="pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019">Pollitt and Anaya (<a href="#ref-pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> argue that in the absence of limits on SO ownership, R. H. Coase’s insights on the nature of the firm suggest that transaction costs would determine whether the SO provides ancillary services themselves or outsources their provision via procurement through <strong>spot markets</strong> (markets that involve immediate trade) <span class="citation" data-cites="coaseNatureFirm1937">(<a href="#ref-coaseNatureFirm1937" role="doc-biblioref">Coase, 1937</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Ancillary services are often] associated with significant uncertainties about how much to procure and may be subject to significant market power within the limited local area that they are needed (especially for voltage support and constraint management). (…) Internal production works well in conditions of uncertainty about how much to procure and/or how the costs of different quality features trade off with each other. In-house production can also be a good way to manage external suppliers who would otherwise exercise market power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This excerpt alludes to the “quality constraint” imposed by the construct of (spot) markets. As I discuss in Section 4.4.3.2 and Section 5.3, spot markets work best with well-defined, fungible and discrete products. However, such products ignore interdependencies and the wide technical capability “spectrum” of power system resources <span class="citation" data-cites="gimonGridPhysicsMarkets2020">(<a href="#ref-gimonGridPhysicsMarkets2020" role="doc-biblioref">Gimon, 2020</a>)</span>. The question here is whether the potential benefits of spot market competition and transparency outweigh those of SO coordination and a more nuanced or layered approach to the procurement of different services. Coordination is particularly desirable for balancing flexibility services that are “lumpy” and/or inseparable from other services. For example, mechanical inertia provision requires the commitment of synchronous generation, which in turn augments rotor angle stability and system strength <span class="citation" data-cites="billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020">(<a href="#ref-billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020" role="doc-biblioref">Billimoria et al., 2020</a>)</span>. A practical (or “second-best”) solution to procuring these types of balancing flexibility is for the SO to use long-term bilateral contracts. Contracting can be a preferable procurement mechanism in the presence of uncertainty or market power, or where there is a requirement for a tailored service or a multi-faceted product <span class="citation" data-cites="pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019">(<a href="#ref-pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019" role="doc-biblioref">Pollitt and Anaya, 2019</a>)</span>. If there are benefits to be gained from competitive pressure, contracts can be awarded to market participants through tender processes designed to assess a single criterion (e.g. price) or multiple criteria (e.g. price, community benefit and delivery risk) <span class="citation" data-cites="reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007">(<a href="#ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007" role="doc-biblioref">Y.

<h4 data-number="4.5.2.4" id="the-design-problem-is-underdetermined"><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2.4</span> The design problem is underdetermined</h4>
<p>The design problem for balancing practices is <strong>underdetermined</strong>. In other words, there are many possible design solution configurations. As I argue in Section 5.3, this is because some processes, services and markets have overlapping roles and functions. The primary challenges of a wide solution space are that policy-makers must determine the trade-offs between different design objectives for each solution configuration (e.g. between complexity, reducing constraints on the system and the level of nuance or layering in the suite of power system services), and must also assess which trade-offs are most acceptable across all practical solution configurations <span class="citation" data-cites="vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016">(<a href="#ref-vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016" role="doc-biblioref">van der Veen and Hakvoort, 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.5.2.5" id="grid-architectures"><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2.5</span> Grid architectures</h4>
<p>Power systems are becoming increasingly distributed as they integrate large numbers of consumer-owned energy resources. This shift has prompted policy-makers to propose new <strong>grid architectures</strong> that re-envisage the roles of and relationships between actors and resources in their jurisdictions <span class="citation" data-cites="conejoRethinkingRestructuredElectricity2018">(<a href="#ref-conejoRethinkingRestructuredElectricity2018" role="doc-biblioref">Conejo and Sioshansi, 2018</a>)</span>.

Transitioning to any one grid architecture requires forward-looking balancing practice design; however, given that long-term planning involves deep uncertainties <span class="citation" data-cites="lambertChallengeLongTermPolicy2003">(<a href="#ref-lambertChallengeLongTermPolicy2003" role="doc-biblioref">Lambert et al., 2003</a>)</span>, policy-makers must maximise design flexibility (or alternatively, reduce the number of design and system constraints imposed by operational practices) to retain option value <span class="citation" data-cites="fisherInvestmentUncertaintyOption2000">(<a href="#ref-fisherInvestmentUncertaintyOption2000" role="doc-biblioref">Fisher, 2000</a>)</span>.</p>
<h4 data-number="4.5.2.6" id="diversity-of-initial-conditions-and-outcomes"><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2.6</span> Diversity of initial conditions and outcomes</h4>
<p>The design process has proceeded differently across jurisdictions due, in part, to technological, infrastructural, institutional, geographical and behavioural differences <span class="citation" data-cites="papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018 ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022">(<a href="#ref-ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022" role="doc-biblioref">Ahlqvist et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018" role="doc-biblioref">Papaefthymiou et al., 2018</a>)</span>. These differences are likely to persist as jurisdictions revisit their balancing practices due to the <strong>path dependency</strong> of energy systems (i.e. initial “lock-ins” have a large bearing on what system trajectories and futures are considered to be possible) <span class="citation" data-cites="fouquetPathDependenceEnergy2016">(<a href="#ref-fouquetPathDependenceEnergy2016" role="doc-biblioref">Fouquet, 2016</a>)</span>. Diversity of initial conditions and outcomes poses a challenge to the design problem because policy-makers in one jurisdiction must judge the experiences with a particular practice in another jurisdiction within that context. In other words, experiences from one jurisdiction do not transfer straightforwardly to another.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.6" id="sec:lit_review-gap"><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Conclusion: the knowledge gap</h2>
<p>In light of increasing penetrations of VRE, policy-makers worldwide are contemplating redesigning operational balancing practices in their jurisdictions. The task of designing effective and efficient operational practices requires them to build an understanding of several facets of the design problem, including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The technical capabilities and constraints of power system resources and system control strategies;</li>
<li>The socioeconomic objectives of the power system;</li>
<li>The institutional arrangements of a jurisdiction; and</li>
<li>The broader cultural and political factors that have influenced the organisation of the electricity industry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though developing this understanding is a significant undertaking in and of itself, the design problem is made even more complex by 1) the presence of existing tensions and challenges and 2) a changing resource mix. The first means that whilst “operating power systems primarily relying on [VRE] is technologically possible”, the design process is “institutionally complex” <span class="citation" data-cites="papaefthymiou100RenewableEnergy2016">(<a href="#ref-papaefthymiou100RenewableEnergy2016" role="doc-biblioref">Papaefthymiou and Dragoon, 2016, p. 81</a>)</span>. The second invites new perspectives on challenges and solutions – for example, proponents of stronger price formation in real-time markets now not only argue that it is essential for efficient operation of and investment in utility-scale resources, but also that it is necessary so that the market can serve as a means to coordinate distributed consumer-owned energy resources <span class="citation" data-cites="hoganMarketDesignPractices2019">(<a href="#ref-hoganMarketDesignPractices2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hogan, 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Policy-makers must confront and account for these complexities to design the flexible operational practices required to effectively and efficiently operate complex power systems and electricity markets undergoing a transition to renewable energy. Whilst the literature has identified high-level design outcomes and the design areas that deserve the most attention, there is, as <span class="citation" data-cites="maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021">Mays (<a href="#ref-maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> indicates, a role for empirical work that identifies “second-best” design solutions given the specific context of each power system and jurisdiction. This approach to the design problem recognises that purpose-fit balancing practices arise not from “optimal” settings, but from solutions that combine and compromise.</p>
<p>With the need for robust design decisions supported by context-specific analysis, the work in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 contributes to the field of power system operational practice design by providing recommendations to system operators, market designers and energy system policy-makers based on models and detailed empirical studies of facets of the Australian National Electricity Market. Whilst some of the recommendations in these chapters may be unsuitable for other jurisdictions, the work in this thesis also contributes to the broader literature by providing a framework for policy-makers elsewhere of how to approach “second-best” and context-specific design when assessing which practices are best to successfully balance electricity markets in operational timeframes with growing penetrations of variable renewable energy.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.1" id="research-question-and-objectives"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Research question and objectives</h2>
<p>The research question that this thesis aims to address is outlined below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Given existing design challenges and increasing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources as energy transition proceeds, how should we design operational practices for balancing electricity markets?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the full scope of this research question is not possible to address within a single doctoral thesis, I focus on aspects of the design problem that are encompassed by the three following research objectives.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.1.1" id="research-objective-1"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Research Objective 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To determine what features are needed in centrally-coordinated arrangements for procuring frequency control services during energy transition.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frequency control services are a significant component of a system operator’s balancing toolkit and are critical to ensuring that imbalances are quickly addressed. The design of frequency control arrangements in restructured electricity industries will need to be revisited as resource mixes, network topologies and broader market arrangements and policy settings change with growing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources. Existing literature on the design of frequency control arrangements has tended to focus on arrangements in a particular jurisdiction with limited consideration of international experience from jurisdictions with alternative arrangements. Furthermore, few existing studies consider the design problem through both an engineering and economics lens, and even fewer focus on what features are required to ensure that frequency control arrangements can meet the demands of energy transition for years to come. It is also worth noting that previous studies of the design of frequency control arrangements in the NEM do not capture recent experiences with deteriorating frequency performance, the reintroduction of mandatory requirements and the integration of high shares of VRE.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 aims to address these shortcomings in the existing literature and provide a perspective on what features are desirable in the market-based frequency control arrangements as jurisdictions decarbonise. In this chapter, I provide a high-level overview and comparison of the key features of frequency control arrangements in North America and Central and Western Europe, and identify the most prominent challenges to designing effective and efficient frequency control arrangements and potential solutions to these challenges. I then assess the performance of evolving arrangements in the NEM in delivering improved frequency control outcomes, with particular regard to growing renewable penetrations and evident tensions between mandatory requirements and market-based incentives. Based on this assessment and a discussion of the trade-offs between effective and efficient outcomes, I draw out four key insights on designing frequency control arrangements as power system capabilities and needs change: 1) Understanding control action interactions, 2) implementing efficient price formation and cost-allocation mechanisms, 3) monitoring and assessing service provision to better align participant remuneration with service quality, and 4) considering both regulatory and market mechanisms and their consequences and interactions.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.1.2" id="research-objective-2"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Research Objective 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To better understand how balancing flexibility capabilities in scheduling timeframes are changing during energy transition, and how these changes might impact the suitability and design of more decentralised operational balancing practices.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In wholesale electricity markets, market participation decisions determine the type and quantity of balancing flexibility available within scheduling timeframes. There is a role for empirical studies examining whether decentralised operational balancing practices, such as markets for services and products, are purpose-fit to deliver the balancing flexibility requirements of electricity markets in transition – particularly given that new markets for flexibility (e.g. reserve product markets) can introduce additional costs, constraints and complexity, and even encroach upon the functions of existing operational practices. Previous studies have neglected this consideration and have, for the most part, proposed or relied upon flexibility quantification methods that are less useful to policy-makers assessing, comparing and designing changes to decentralised balancing practices. Furthermore, there has been limited work that examines how the duration of certain types of balancing flexibility might affect the suitability of certain decentralised operational balancing practices.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 addresses this gap in the literature by quantifying balancing flexibility capabilities in scheduling timeframes both now and into the near future to inform market design. In this chapter, I offer a practical method for quantifying the time-varying spectrum of upwards and downwards balancing flexibility capabilities, and then use this method to assess historical and projected resource mixes in two regions of the Australian NEM. The results from my analysis suggest that with higher penetrations of renewable energy: 1) downwards flexibility margins can be exhausted around noon if wind and solar are unable or unwilling to provide it, 2) upwards flexibility becomes more scarce during morning and evening peak demand events and 3) a greater portion of upwards flexibility is provided by energy-limited resources. Using these findings, I examine and compare the suitability of various flexibility design options, with a particular focus on assessing the need for an additional reserve product market. I recommend that policy-makers examine how existing operational practices can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility provision, and that duration specifications and sustained footroom procurement be considered for reserve products.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.1.3" id="research-objective-3"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3</span> Research Objective 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To explore how more decentralised operational balancing practices can be configured to maximise the deployability of balancing flexibility in scheduling timeframes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the quantity of balancing flexibility available in a power system is inadequate if market participants are unable or unwilling to offer resource flexibility into wholesale electricity markets. Market participation decisions and thus resource schedules are informed by knowledge processes, which provide current and forecasted power system and market information. As such, these knowledge processes and, more broadly, market participation rules must be purpose-fit to enable resource scheduling that leads to effective and efficient system balancing. To the best of my knowledge, there are only a few studies that discuss the significance of market information and market participation rules in scheduling power system resources in electricity markets. However, none of these studies use empirical evidence to support scheduling or policy recommendations. Furthermore, whilst previous studies have examined the impact of imperfect foresight on energy storage resources with different storage durations, they do not simulate storage operation in fast markets (i.e. dispatch decisions every 5 minutes) with high real-time prices and significant penetrations of VRE.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 explores how market information and market participant operational strategies impact the deployability of balancing flexibility from energy-limited storage resources, which are expected to aid in balancing electricity markets with high penetrations of variable renewable energy through energy arbitrage. In this chapter, I focus on the scheduling coordination role of centralised price forecasts generated by the system and market operator in Australian NEM. I highlight the increasing frequency and severity of errors in these price forecasts, and propose a hypothesis that market participant (re)bidding is partially responsible for this phenomenon. I then model the extent to which arbitrage revenues might be reduced (compared to perfect foresight operation) should these forecasts guide battery energy storage scheduling. Based on the findings from these analyses, I discuss potential changes to market participant scheduling strategies and market design that could improve scheduling outcomes. I recommend that Australian policy-makers not only increase the frequency at which centralised knowledge processes are run, but also consider whether stricter market participation restrictions might incentivise participant bidding strategies that are less likely to induce sudden price forecast swings that can hamper effective scheduling.</p>
<h3 data-number="5.1.4" id="case-studies-of-the-australian-national-electricity-market"><span class="header-section-number">5.1.4</span> Case studies of the Australian National Electricity Market</h3>
<p>Whilst this thesis aims to achieve these research objectives and thus produce insights for policy-makers worldwide, I draw on experiences from the Australian NEM and use its resource configurations and market arrangements in the case studies contained within this thesis. Research from the NEM should be of interest to electricity market designers elsewhere for several reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Relative to other jurisdictions, the NEM regularly experiences high instantaneous penetrations of renewable energy (a maximum of 72.9% in November 2023<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>) and <em>variable</em> renewable energy (a maximum of 71.9% in November 2023<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>). As such, the changes in balancing flexibility capabilities and requirements in the NEM that are discussed in this thesis foreshadow those that are likely to occur in other jurisdictions as they decarbonise their electricity supply.</li>
<li>Similarly, the NEM has seen world-leading deployments of rooftop solar PV and other consumer-owned energy resources. These resources constitute a significant part of the resource mix (as high as 48% in a single market interval in October 2023<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>). Electricity market designers worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned with the impact of these resources on system balancing and are considering how best to facilitate the provision of balancing flexibility from these resources to the benefit of both the system and consumers. In this thesis, I touch on the impact of consumer-owned energy resources on balancing, and which operational features and practices best enable these resources to offer balancing flexibility to the wider system. However, distributed and consumer-owned energy resources are not a focus of this thesis.</li>
<li>Many of the world’s electricity markets are considering or adopting design features, such as short market intervals and faster frequency control service markets, that have long been a part of the NEM’s design. As such, experience from the NEM documented in this thesis can inform how or even whether certain design features should be implemented elsewhere.</li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="5.2" id="research-methods"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Research methods</h2>
<p>To achieve the objectives outlined in the previous subsection, I use three research methods: literature review, system and market data analysis and techno-economic modelling.

<p>Frequency control services are a significant component of a system operator’s balancing toolkit and are critical to ensuring that imbalances are quickly addressed. The design of frequency control arrangements in restructured electricity industries will need to be revisited as resource mixes, network topologies and broader market arrangements and policy settings change with growing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources. This chapter aims to provide a perspective on what features are desirable in the market-based frequency control arrangements as jurisdictions decarbonise by drawing on experiences from the Australian National Electricity Market. The purpose of this chapter is to address the first research objective of this thesis:</p>

<h2 data-number="6.2" id="abstract-1"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Abstract</h2>
<p>For restructured electricity industries undergoing energy transition, designing effective and efficient frequency control arrangements is a complex and ongoing task that requires appropriate configuration of controllers, generator technical connection requirements, market arrangements and wider policy settings. In this paper, we provide an overview and assessment of these arrangements in Australia’s National Electricity Market - a useful case study given its long-standing frequency control ancillary services markets, yet recent challenges in maintaining secure frequency control. We assess the performance of these evolving arrangements in delivering improved frequency control outcomes, with particular regard to growing renewable penetrations and evident tensions between mandatory requirements and market-based incentives. Based on this assessment, we draw out four key insights on designing frequency control arrangements as power system capabilities and needs change: 1) Understanding control action interactions, 2) Implementing efficient price formation and cost-allocation mechanisms, 3) Monitoring and assessing service provision to better align participant remuneration with service quality, and 4) Considering both regulatory and market mechanisms and their consequences and interactions. In particular, we discuss the trade-offs between effective and efficient outcomes, and provide arguments for more robust and forward-looking frequency control arrangements during energy transition.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.3" id="sec:fcs-intro"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>As a consequence of growing momentum to address global warming and continually declining technology costs, many power systems around the world are undergoing an energy transition in which significant capacity additions of variable renewable energy (VRE) and other inverter-based resources (IBR) are being accompanied by the progressive retirement of existing fossil fuel generation <span class="citation" data-cites="internationalenergyagencyNetZero20502021">(<a href="#ref-internationalenergyagencyNetZero20502021" role="doc-biblioref">International Energy Agency, 2021</a>)</span>. Such power systems are currently experiencing or expected to soon experience high instantaneous penetrations of VRE (i.e. beyond 50% of grid demand being met by VRE at any given time), which can pose technical challenges to the stable and secure operation of a power system <span class="citation" data-cites="kroposkiAchieving100Renewable2017 kenyonStabilityControlPower2020 meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021">(<a href="#ref-kenyonStabilityControlPower2020" role="doc-biblioref">Kenyon et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-kroposkiAchieving100Renewable2017" role="doc-biblioref">Kroposki et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021" role="doc-biblioref">Meegahapola et al., 2021</a>)</span>. While several of these challenges have technological solutions of various maturities, configuring mechanisms in an effective and efficient manner across power system design layers, which span from how resources are controlled to how grid codes and markets are designed, remains an open and significant challenge.</p>
<p>In this article, we focus on one aspect of power system security: control of AC frequency. Maintaining frequency near the nominal value of a power system (either 50 or 60 Hz) is contingent on the ongoing balance of active power supply and demand within a synchronous area <span class="citation" data-cites="graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994">(<a href="#ref-graingerPowerSystemAnalysis1994" role="doc-biblioref">Grainger, 1994</a>)</span>. Power system frequency deviations are a consequence of instantaneous supply-demand imbalances, which typically occur as a result of system variability (predictable changes in supply or demand, such as fluctuations and ramps of generation or load) and uncertainty (unpredicted changes in supply or demand, such as forecast errors or unplanned outages) <span class="citation" data-cites="elaOperatingReservesVariable2011">(<a href="#ref-elaOperatingReservesVariable2011" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2011</a>)</span>. System operators (SOs) achieve short-term active power balancing using reserve capacity. Whilst there are many names for these reserves<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, this article will focus on a common subset that responds to and mitigates frequency deviations over short timeframes (milliseconds to minutes). We will refer to such reserves as <em>Frequency Control Services</em> (FCS). If FCS are insufficient or inadequate, the system frequency may deviate beyond acceptable system limits and lead to equipment damage, load shedding, generator trips and cascading failures that lead to blackouts <span class="citation" data-cites="kirbyFrequencyControlConcerns2002 ulbigImpactLowRotational2014">(<a href="#ref-kirbyFrequencyControlConcerns2002" role="doc-biblioref">Kirby et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#ref-ulbigImpactLowRotational2014" role="doc-biblioref">Ulbig et al., 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In electricity industries with competitive markets for energy and FCS, frequency control arrangements consist of control, regulatory and market-based mechanisms <span class="citation" data-cites="mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021">(<a href="#ref-mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021" role="doc-biblioref">Mancarella and Billimoria, 2021</a>)</span>. Control mechanisms specify the technical requirements for FCS. Regulatory and market-based mechanisms are used by the SO to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mandate or incentivise participant behaviour in the energy market that facilitates system balancing. This includes enforcing dispatch compliance or penalising participant portfolio imbalances; and</p></li>
<li><p>Procure FCS from capable resources (i.e. generators, loads and network elements).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Regulatory FCS procurement mechanisms are often mandatory and include equipment standards, connection requirements and SO intervention, whereas market-based FCS procurement mechanisms are often voluntary and include remunerative schemes and contract or spot markets. Together, these mechanisms dictate the physical effectiveness and productive, dynamic, price formation and cost-allocation efficiencies of FCS provision and procurement. Well-designed arrangements should be effective and efficient, where <em>effectiveness</em> entails sufficient and robust frequency response to meet physical power system requirements and <em>efficiency</em> relates to frequency response being provided at low cost, both now and into the future <span class="citation" data-cites="reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007 vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016">(<a href="#ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007" role="doc-biblioref">Y. Rebours et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016" role="doc-biblioref">van der Veen and Hakvoort, 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As power systems transition towards higher instantaneous penetrations of VRE and IBR, SOs are likely to face the following challenges to short-term system balancing that may require existing frequency control arrangements to be revisited:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>VRE adds variability and uncertainty to a power system, particularly if similar technologies are situated within close proximity of one another (i.e. correlated production and/or forecast errors) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020 keeratimahatAnalysisShorttermOperational2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020d</a>; <a href="#ref-keeratimahatAnalysisShorttermOperational2021" role="doc-biblioref">Keeratimahat et al., 2021</a>)</span>. Furthermore, unless an appropriate response is incorporated and enabled in their control systems, VRE and other IBR do not provide FCS. In jurisdictions that do not require, incentivise or allow VRE and IBR to provide FCS, the displacement of synchronous machines in dispatch has led to lower availabilities of resources that provide FCS <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020c milanoFoundationsChallengesLowInertia2018 denholmInertiaPowerGrid2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020c" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020g</a>; <a href="#ref-denholmInertiaPowerGrid2020" role="doc-biblioref">Denholm et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-milanoFoundationsChallengesLowInertia2018" role="doc-biblioref">Milano et al., 2018</a>)</span> .</p></li>
<li><p>In jurisdictions with competitive markets for energy and FCS, there is a tension between achieving economically efficient markets and the redundancy, certainty and control afforded to the SO. While the societal and economic costs of power system failure are often very large, it may be difficult for the SO to justify the cost of mitigation measures when they are ongoing or significant and when the joint probability of events or failures is low. The uncertainties associated with energy transition and the impacts of global warming are likely to present additional challenges. Power system security measures may need to be implemented rapidly and be both robust to a range of futures and resilient in the face of shocks, such as severe weather events <span class="citation" data-cites="prakashResponseFrequencyControl2021 egglestonSecurityResilienceTechnical2021">(<a href="#ref-egglestonSecurityResilienceTechnical2021" role="doc-biblioref">Eggleston et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-prakashResponseFrequencyControl2021" role="doc-biblioref">Prakash et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this paper, we provide insights and recommendations on designing more effective and efficient frequency control arrangements based on experience from the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The NEM is currently experiencing relatively high system-wide instantaneous VRE penetrations (just over 60% in 2021) and is expected to experience penetrations as high as 75-100% by 2025 <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorNEMEngineeringFramework2021 australianenergymarketoperatorQuarterlyEnergyDynamics2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorNEMEngineeringFramework2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021b</a>, <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorQuarterlyEnergyDynamics2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021c</a>)</span>. Though the NEM’s frequency control arrangements were once arguably world-leading <span class="citation" data-cites="thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007 rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015">(<a href="#ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015" role="doc-biblioref">Riesz et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007" role="doc-biblioref">Thorncraft and Outhred, 2007</a>)</span>, the speed at which system capabilities and needs are changing and the removal of mandatory requirements in 2001 as a part of a paradigm shift from obligation to remuneration for FCS have exposed design issues. In attempting to address these issues, the NEM’s rule makers have placed FCS obligations on generators and transmission network operators and have undertaken reforms to the NEM’s energy and FCS markets, including introducing a new market to procure emergency fast frequency response (FFR) from IBR. Whilst the NEM is an electrically-isolated power system with a relatively simple energy-only market, the insights and recommendations from this paper are likely to be relevant to other power systems and interconnections as their existing conventional generation retires and VRE deployment levels increase.</p>
<p>This paper offers three contributions to the literature. First, we provide a high-level overview and comparison of the key features of frequency control arrangements in North America and Central and Western Europe, and provide a review of the most prominent challenges to designing effective and efficient frequency control arrangements and the potential solutions discussed in the literature. Second, we provide a comprehensive update to previous literature on frequency control in the NEM <span class="citation" data-cites="thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007 thorncraftMarketbasedAncillaryServices2008 rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015">(<a href="#ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015" role="doc-biblioref">Riesz et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-thorncraftMarketbasedAncillaryServices2008" role="doc-biblioref">Thorncraft et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007" role="doc-biblioref">Thorncraft and Outhred, 2007</a>)</span>. Our analysis benefits from recent experience in the NEM that encompasses deteriorating frequency performance, the reintroduction of mandatory requirements and integrating higher shares of VRE. While several of these aspects have been discussed independently in the literature, this paper seeks to provide a structured and holistic analysis of developments in the NEM and their implications for frequency control arrangement design. Third, this article advocates for designers placing a greater emphasis on delivering forward-looking frequency control arrangements during energy transition through the implementation of more robust regulatory mechanisms and ensuring that market-based mechanisms are capable of supporting FCS investment. As highlighted in the following sections, these design features have received surprisingly little attention in the literature.</p>
<p>The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. In Section 4.4, we provide an overview of typical frequency control arrangements, with a focus on restructured electricity industries in North America and Europe, and the main challenges faced in their design. We describe the NEM, its frequency control arrangements and the specific challenges posed by increasing penetrations of VRE and other IBR in Section 4.5. In Section 4.6, we analyse the performance of the NEM’s frequency control arrangements in responding to the challenges explored in Section 4.4, with primary frequency response and regulation (secondary frequency response) services in the NEM as case studies. Based on our analysis, we conclude by offering four key insights to operators, regulators and market-bodies that include understanding control action interactions; ensuring that arrangements are capable of supporting investment in FCS capability; monitoring, assessing and remunerating FCS performance; and considering both regulatory and market-based mechanisms in the design of effective and efficient frequency control arrangements.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.4.1" id="conventional-frequency-control-schemes"><span class="header-section-number">6.4.1</span> Conventional frequency control schemes</h3>
<p>SOs employ hierarchical and sequential frequency control schemes. In most power systems, such schemes implicitly include inertial response and explicitly define FCS such as primary frequency response (PFR), secondary frequency response (SFR) and tertiary frequency response (TFR). In general, once frequency has deviated from the system nominal value, synchronous machines provide an inertial response that is inherent and immediate in slowing the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF). Within seconds, generators and/or loads provide autonomous and decentralised control action through PFR <span class="citation" data-cites="etoFrequencyControlRequirements2018 machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020">(<a href="#ref-etoFrequencyControlRequirements2018" role="doc-biblioref">Eto et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-machowskiPowerSystemDynamics2020" role="doc-biblioref">Machowski et al., 2020</a>)</span>. PFR arrests the frequency deviation to enable the slower and more centralised control actions of SFR and TFR to return the power system frequency to its nominal value <span class="citation" data-cites="etoUseFrequencyResponse2010 elaAlternativeApproachesIncentivizing2012">(<a href="#ref-elaAlternativeApproachesIncentivizing2012" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2012b</a>; <a href="#ref-etoUseFrequencyResponse2010" role="doc-biblioref">Eto et al., 2010</a>)</span>. Should system frequency continue to rise or fall beyond the system’s allowable limits, emergency protection schemes such as under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) and over-frequency generation shedding (OFGS) relays may be triggered. In some systems, RoCoF relays are also used to prevent high RoCoFs from tripping or damaging equipment and to contain frequency nadirs and zeniths <span class="citation" data-cites="dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016 millerAdvisoryEquipmentLimits2017 akramEnergyStorageShortTerm2020">(<a href="#ref-akramEnergyStorageShortTerm2020" role="doc-biblioref">Akram et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016" role="doc-biblioref">DGA Consulting, 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-millerAdvisoryEquipmentLimits2017" role="doc-biblioref">Miller et al., 2017a</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Except for inertial response from synchronous machines, the SO procures FCS capacity from capable resources within its control area and, in the case of SFR and TFR, activates FCS energy if necessary. In electricity industries where the SO owns most if not all the generation assets (i.e. a vertically-integrated utility), the SO is able to jointly schedule generation and FCS capacity with knowledge of the condition of the system and the status and cost structures of their plant. However, many electricity industries have undergone some degree of restructuring, which has created a greater role for competitively-oriented decentralised decision-making <span class="citation" data-cites="vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016">(<a href="#ref-vanderveenElectricityBalancingMarket2016" role="doc-biblioref">van der Veen and Hakvoort, 2016</a>)</span> . The diverse outcomes of restructuring processes and differences in technical characteristics (e.g. capabilities of resource mix and network topology) have led to a wide range of frequency control arrangements across power systems <span class="citation" data-cites="reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007 poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019">(<a href="#ref-poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019" role="doc-biblioref">Poplavskaya and de Vries, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007" role="doc-biblioref">Y.

<p>In restructured electricity industries, the provision of more passive FCS (e.g. ride-through capabilities) is usually mandated by regulatory mechanisms such as connection agreements and grid codes, whereas FCS that require additional response capabilities or impose opportunity-costs on suppliers are procured and remunerated by the SO through market-based mechanisms. In Section 4.4.2.1 &amp; Section 4.4.2.2, we provide an overview of typical features<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and key developments in market-based mechanisms for procuring FCS in North America and Central and Western Europe, respectively. These regions best represent the two prevailing short-term wholesale electricity market models: central dispatch markets, in which the SO issues dispatch instructions, and decentralised or self-dispatch markets, in which resource dispatch is managed by market participants <span class="citation" data-cites="ahlqvistCentralSelfDispatchElectricity2018">(<a href="#ref-ahlqvistCentralSelfDispatchElectricity2018" role="doc-biblioref">Ahlqvist et al., 2018</a>)</span>. Given that FCS and energy are partially substitutable goods, the characteristics of short-term wholesale electricity markets heavily influence the design of FCS arrangements and thus these regions provide an interesting contrast. However, despite their differences, the SO plays a central role in both of these regions as they determine the area demand for FCS capacity, activate FCS energy as required and are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the power system is balanced and securely operated.</p>
<h4 data-number="6.4.2.1" id="sec:fcs-NA"><span class="header-section-number">6.4.2.1</span> North American markets</h4>
<p>In North America, central dispatch wholesale electricity markets are operated by an Independent System Operator (ISO) or Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) and are distributed across three synchronous areas. These markets consist of two short-term centralised platforms: a day-ahead market and a real-time market. In the day-ahead market, the SO solves a security-constrained unit commitment problem using supply offers (single or three-part) and demand bids (quantity or price-quantity) to produce day-ahead locational marginal prices and a financially-binding hourly schedule. In the real-time market, the SO solves a security-constrained economic dispatch problem (typically every five minutes) using generator price-quantity offers and a demand forecast to produce real-time locational marginal prices and a set of physically and financially binding dispatch instructions. Thus, each short-term market is cleared to maximise social welfare whilst respecting network and system security constraints <span class="citation" data-cites="chowElectricityMarketDesign2005 cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017">(<a href="#ref-chowElectricityMarketDesign2005" role="doc-biblioref">Chow et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017" role="doc-biblioref">Cramton, 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Except for Frequency Responsive Reserves (i.e. PFR), operating reserves (i.e. FCS capacity) are explicitly procured by placing an obligation on load-serving entities to self-provide or purchase their share from SO-run FCS markets <span class="citation" data-cites="elaAlternativeApproachesIncentivizing2012 zhouSurveyAncillaryServices2016">(<a href="#ref-elaAlternativeApproachesIncentivizing2012" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2012b</a>; <a href="#ref-zhouSurveyAncillaryServices2016" role="doc-biblioref">Zhou et al., 2016</a>)</span>. These FCS markets are usually integrated into day-ahead market and, in most jurisdictions, the real-time market. Standard products in North American markets include Regulation (i.e. SFR during normal operation), Spinning and Non-Spinning Reserves (i.e. TFR deployed following an event) <span class="citation" data-cites="zhouSurveyAncillaryServices2016 elaAncillaryServicesUnited2019 hewickerDimensioningControlReserves2020">(<a href="#ref-elaAncillaryServicesUnited2019" role="doc-biblioref">Ela and Hytowitz, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-hewickerDimensioningControlReserves2020" role="doc-biblioref">Hewicker et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-zhouSurveyAncillaryServices2016" role="doc-biblioref">Zhou et al., 2016</a>)</span>. Participants can submit offers for FCS in addition to offer for energy. Unit commitment and economic dispatch permit co-optimisation of energy and FCS procurement. From the perspective of the SO, co-optimisation ensures that the total system cost of achieving an energy supply-demand balance is minimised alongside FCS requirements, subject to network and system security constraints. From the perspective of participants, co-optimisation leads to an FCS price that not only reflects the price offer of the marginal resource, but also any "profit" it forgoes in the energy market (assuming supplier offers reflect their short-run marginal costs) <span class="citation" data-cites="isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009 elaEffectiveAncillaryServices2012">(<a href="#ref-elaEffectiveAncillaryServices2012" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2012a</a>; <a href="#ref-isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009" role="doc-biblioref">Isemonger, 2009</a>)</span>. As such, ISO/RTO FCS markets can compensate opportunity-costs related to the day-ahead and/or real-time market but only allocate costs to load-serving entities through a procurement obligation.</p>
<p>Though North American FCS markets have predominantly procured and remunerated FCS capacity, ISO/RTOs (except Texas’ ISO, ERCOT) were ordered to also remunerate Regulation providers for the quantity of energy provided whilst accurately following control signals by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Order 755 <span class="citation" data-cites="federalenergyregulatorycommissionfercOrderNo7552011">(<a href="#ref-federalenergyregulatorycommissionfercOrderNo7552011" role="doc-biblioref">Commission, 2011</a>)</span>. As such, Regulation providers offer a quantity of capacity, a price for capacity and a price for "mileage", which is the energy delivered. Remuneration for Regulation takes performance (the ability of a resource to follow the ISO/RTO’s control signals) into account, though how this is implemented varies between ISO/RTOs <span class="citation" data-cites="elaAncillaryServicesUnited2019 fernandez-munozFastFrequencyControl2020">(<a href="#ref-elaAncillaryServicesUnited2019" role="doc-biblioref">Ela and Hytowitz, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-fernandez-munozFastFrequencyControl2020" role="doc-biblioref">Fernández-Muñoz et al., 2020</a>)</span>. A notable example is the PJM RTO, which uses both a standard SFR control signal (RegA) and faster SFR control signal (RegD) intended for battery energy storage systems (BESS). PJM determines how interchangeable a resource’s RegD provision is with RegA provision (the marginal benefit factor) to clear the Regulation market and calculates a performance score for use in market clearing and settlement. However, according to the independent market monitor, the omission of the marginal benefit factor from market settlement has led to perverse market outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="brooksReviewFrequencyRegulation2019 monitoringanalytics2021QuarterlyState2021">(<a href="#ref-brooksReviewFrequencyRegulation2019" role="doc-biblioref">Brooks and Lesieutre, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-monitoringanalytics2021QuarterlyState2021" role="doc-biblioref">Monitoring Analytics, 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<h4 data-number="6.4.2.2" id="sec:fcs-EU"><span class="header-section-number">6.4.2.2</span> European markets</h4>
<p>Most of the electricity markets of Central and Western Europe are self-dispatch and consist of two short-term platforms: the day-ahead market and the intraday market, which can be continuous, composed of frequently-run discrete auctions or a combination of the two. Each of these platforms is coupled across the majority of market zones in Europe, with a single price coupling algorithm used to simultaneously clear zonal day-ahead markets and a single order book compiled to match cross-zonal intraday orders <span class="citation" data-cites="nemocommitteeSingleIntradayCoupling epexspotEuropeanMarketCoupling">(<a href="#ref-epexspotEuropeanMarketCoupling" role="doc-biblioref">EPEX Spot, n.d.</a>; <a href="#ref-nemocommitteeSingleIntradayCoupling" role="doc-biblioref">NEMO Committee, n.d.</a>)</span>. In contrast to North American electricity markets, the market operator is responsible for market operation and is distinct from the Transmission System Operator (TSO). Generation and load are managed by Balancing Responsible Parties (BRP), which must submit binding operational schedules to the TSO ahead of delivery (often by the day prior to delivery). As BRPs become aware of potential deviations closer to real time (e.g. improved forecasts), they are able to adjust their submitted schedules (i.e. remain "balanced") through trades on the intraday market <span class="citation" data-cites="lagoMarketFrameworkGrid2021 musgensEconomicsDesignBalancing2014">(<a href="#ref-lagoMarketFrameworkGrid2021" role="doc-biblioref">Lago et al., 2021b</a>; <a href="#ref-musgensEconomicsDesignBalancing2014" role="doc-biblioref">Müsgens et al., 2014</a>)</span>. BRPs face financial repercussions if they are imbalanced via an imbalance price and, in some jurisdictions, are legally obliged to be balanced <span class="citation" data-cites="entso-ewgasSurveyAncillaryServices2021">(<a href="#ref-entso-ewgasSurveyAncillaryServices2021" role="doc-biblioref">ENTSO-E WGAS, 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Following gate-closure of the intraday market, residual imbalances are primarily addressed by FCS (known as balancing services) procured by the TSO. Standard FCS in Europe include Frequency Containment Reserve (i.e. PFR), automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves (i.e. SFR), and manual Frequency Restoration Reserves and Replacement Reserves (i.e. both TFR), with minimum technical requirements for each specified by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) <span class="citation" data-cites="europeannetworkoftransmissionsystemoperatorsforelectricityentso-eNetworkCodeLoadFrequency2013">(<a href="#ref-europeannetworkoftransmissionsystemoperatorsforelectricityentso-eNetworkCodeLoadFrequency2013" role="doc-biblioref">European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, 2013</a>)</span>. Depending on the FCS product and the jurisdiction, TSOs may distinguish between FCS capacity (balancing capacity) and the delivery of FCS energy (balancing energy). The provision of one or both is mandated in some cases, but where both are procured competitively, Balancing Service Providers (BSP) typically submit separate offers for FCS capacity and FCS energy <span class="citation" data-cites="abbasyNationalDesignMultinational2012">(<a href="#ref-abbasyNationalDesignMultinational2012" role="doc-biblioref">Abbasy, 2012</a>)</span>. FCS capacity markets are often cleared days to months in advance of real-time whereas the FCS energy market, which effectively constitutes merit-order or pro rata activation of capacity for FCS energy provision, is cleared within an hour or minutes of real-time <span class="citation" data-cites="poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019 ockerDesignEuropeanBalancing2016 entso-ewgasSurveyAncillaryServices2021">(<a href="#ref-entso-ewgasSurveyAncillaryServices2021" role="doc-biblioref">ENTSO-E WGAS, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-ockerDesignEuropeanBalancing2016" role="doc-biblioref">Ocker et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019" role="doc-biblioref">Poplavskaya and de Vries, 2019</a>)</span>. FCS capacity costs are typically allocated to power system users via a grid tariff. FCS energy costs are typically allocated to BRPs based on their schedule deviations and an imbalance price, which may differ from the FCS energy price paid to BSPs <span class="citation" data-cites="vandezandeWellfunctioningBalancingMarkets2010 hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015">(<a href="#ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015" role="doc-biblioref">Hirth and Ziegenhagen, 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-vandezandeWellfunctioningBalancingMarkets2010" role="doc-biblioref">Vandezande et al., 2010</a>)</span>. As such, European FCS markets generally disincentivise causers of imbalance through the imbalance price, which may also recover or reflect the cost of FCS energy. However, since FCS capacity markets are typically decoupled from and cleared ahead of short-term energy markets, perceived opportunity-costs based on expected short-term energy market prices must be internalised within participants’ FCS offers.</p>
<p>Given the relatively high degree of interconnection between transmission systems in Central and Western Europe, cross-TSO initiatives are in place and being expanded to address imbalances and share FCS across the Continental Europe synchronous area. When sufficient cross-TSO transmission capacity is available, initiatives currently in place enable participating TSOs to jointly procure Frequency Containment Reserve capacity, net imbalances (i.e. reduce the demand for SFR by aggregating individual control area imbalances) and jointly procure automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve capacity and energy <span class="citation" data-cites="europeannetworkoftransmissionsystemoperatorsforelectricityentso-eENTSOEBalancingReport2020">(<a href="#ref-europeannetworkoftransmissionsystemoperatorsforelectricityentso-eENTSOEBalancingReport2020" role="doc-biblioref">European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, 2020</a>)</span>. Further efficiency gains are expected following the implementation of integrated market platforms for imbalance netting and balancing energy for SFR and TFR. The implementation of these platforms is mandated by the European Commission’s European Balancing Guideline and requires certain FCS product definitions and market features to be harmonised across the balancing energy markets of participating TSOs <span class="citation" data-cites="europeancommissionCommissionRegulationEU2017 50hzamprionapgeliartetennetConsultationDesignPlatform2017">(<a href="#ref-50hzamprionapgeliartetennetConsultationDesignPlatform2017" role="doc-biblioref">50hz, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-europeancommissionCommissionRegulationEU2017" role="doc-biblioref">European Commission, 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.4.3" id="sec:fcs-design"><span class="header-section-number">6.4.3</span> Designing frequency control arrangements</h3>
<p>As with any policy problem, designing frequency control arrangements in restructured electricity industries requires design principles, variables and performance criteria to be established.

In contrast, though some design variables are common, others may only apply to particular systems based on their resource mix, network topology and/or market design. <span class="citation" data-cites="reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007">Y.

<p>Despite the well-defined nature of the design problem, there are several challenges to achieving effective and efficient arrangements. In Section 4.4.3.1 &amp; Section 4.4.3.2, we present the most prominent challenges and their treatment in the literature.</p>
<h4 data-number="6.4.3.1" id="sec:fcs-ibr-challenges"><span class="header-section-number">6.4.3.1</span> The influx of VRE and other IBR in power systems</h4>
<p>As discussed in Section 4.3, VRE adds variability and uncertainty to power systems which, at the very least, can lead to increased procurement and activation requirements for PFR and SFR during normal operating conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="elaOperatingReservesVariable2011">(<a href="#ref-elaOperatingReservesVariable2011" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2011</a>)</span>.

The third is for the SO to determine the required quantity of FCS capacity (<em>dimensioning</em>) using dynamic and probabilistic approaches (as opposed to static and deterministic) that adequately reflect current or expected power system conditions and an acceptable level of risk, such as a reliability standard <span class="citation" data-cites="holttinenMethodologiesDetermineOperating2013 devosDynamicDimensioningApproach2019 ortega-vazquezRiskBasedReserveProcurement2020">(<a href="#ref-devosDynamicDimensioningApproach2019" role="doc-biblioref">De Vos et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-holttinenMethodologiesDetermineOperating2013" role="doc-biblioref">Holttinen et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-ortega-vazquezRiskBasedReserveProcurement2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ortega-Vazquez et al., 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In recent years, SOs have become increasingly concerned with growing penetrations of asynchronous IBR leading to higher RoCoFs and fewer resources offering conventional FCS <span class="citation" data-cites="dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016 hartmannEffectsDecreasingSynchronous2019 denholmInertiaPowerGrid2020">(<a href="#ref-denholmInertiaPowerGrid2020" role="doc-biblioref">Denholm et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016" role="doc-biblioref">DGA Consulting, 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-hartmannEffectsDecreasingSynchronous2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hartmann et al., 2019</a>)</span>. However, VRE and other IBR are able to provide tunable conventional FCS, FFR and/or an inherent response that strongly resembles the inertial response of synchronous machines<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> if this is facilitated by arrangement design <span class="citation" data-cites="millerTechnologyCapabilitiesFast2017 fernandez-munozFastFrequencyControl2020 mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021">(<a href="#ref-fernandez-munozFastFrequencyControl2020" role="doc-biblioref">Fernández-Muñoz et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021" role="doc-biblioref">Mancarella and Billimoria, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-millerTechnologyCapabilitiesFast2017" role="doc-biblioref">Miller et al., 2017b</a>)</span>.

<h4 data-number="6.4.3.2" id="sec:fcs-efficiency-challenges"><span class="header-section-number">6.4.3.2</span> Achieving economic efficiency</h4>
<p>Achieving short-run efficiency entails supplier costs being reflected in their offers and adequately propagated to FCS prices, and the SO assigning at least some portion of FCS costs to system users that create a need for procurement or activation. A widely used pricing approach in ISO/RTO co-optimised FCS markets is a marginal price which incorporates the marginal resource’s short-term market opportunity-costs and their offer, which could reflect potential mileage or wear-and-tear costs <span class="citation" data-cites="zhouSurveyAncillaryServices2016 frewImpactOperatingReserve2021">(<a href="#ref-frewImpactOperatingReserve2021" role="doc-biblioref">Frew et al., 2021a</a>; <a href="#ref-zhouSurveyAncillaryServices2016" role="doc-biblioref">Zhou et al., 2016</a>)</span>. Though improving cost-allocation has been repeatedly proposed in North American literature <span class="citation" data-cites="isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009 elaEffectiveAncillaryServices2012 milliganIntegrationVariableGeneration2011">(<a href="#ref-elaEffectiveAncillaryServices2012" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2012a</a>; <a href="#ref-isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009" role="doc-biblioref">Isemonger, 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-milliganIntegrationVariableGeneration2011" role="doc-biblioref">Milligan et al., 2011</a>)</span>, FCS costs are predominantly socialised across loads based on demand or consumption. In Europe, however, much attention has been given to FCS market pricing, scoring (the order in which offers are selected) and cost-allocation. Specifically, literature on European FCS markets has explored whether pay-as-bid or uniform pricing better facilitates suppliers revealing their true costs <span class="citation" data-cites="musgensEconomicsDesignBalancing2014 hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015 ockerHarmonizationEuropeanBalancing2018">(<a href="#ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015" role="doc-biblioref">Hirth and Ziegenhagen, 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-musgensEconomicsDesignBalancing2014" role="doc-biblioref">Müsgens et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-ockerHarmonizationEuropeanBalancing2018" role="doc-biblioref">Ocker et al., 2018</a>)</span>, the particular offers scoring should consider <span class="citation" data-cites="musgensEconomicsDesignBalancing2014 ehrhartDesignRegulationBalancing2021">(<a href="#ref-ehrhartDesignRegulationBalancing2021" role="doc-biblioref">Ehrhart and Ocker, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-musgensEconomicsDesignBalancing2014" role="doc-biblioref">Müsgens et al., 2014</a>)</span> and the design of imbalance prices to sufficiently incentivise short-term balancing <span class="citation" data-cites="vandezandeWellfunctioningBalancingMarkets2010 hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015 papavasiliouScarcityPricingMissing2020">(<a href="#ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015" role="doc-biblioref">Hirth and Ziegenhagen, 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-papavasiliouScarcityPricingMissing2020" role="doc-biblioref">Papavasiliou, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-vandezandeWellfunctioningBalancingMarkets2010" role="doc-biblioref">Vandezande et al., 2010</a>)</span>. Regardless, both European and North American literature suggest that increased competition in FCS markets is a priority. This could be facilitated by enabling distributed and utility-scale VRE and IBR to qualify for FCS provision, reducing minimum offer quantities, separating raise and lower (positive and negative) products and increasing market clearing frequency and the time resolution of FCS products <span class="citation" data-cites="hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015 poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019 lagoMarketFrameworkGrid2021 frewImpactOperatingReserve2021">(<a href="#ref-frewImpactOperatingReserve2021" role="doc-biblioref">Frew et al., 2021a</a>; <a href="#ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015" role="doc-biblioref">Hirth and Ziegenhagen, 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-lagoMarketFrameworkGrid2021" role="doc-biblioref">Lago et al., 2021b</a>; <a href="#ref-poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019" role="doc-biblioref">Poplavskaya and de Vries, 2019</a>)</span>. Despite the typically "shallow" nature of FCS markets (i.e. additional supply can significantly reduce prices <span class="citation" data-cites="rieszDesigningElectricityMarkets2015">(<a href="#ref-rieszDesigningElectricityMarkets2015" role="doc-biblioref">Riesz and Milligan, 2015</a>)</span>), dynamic efficiency has received considerably less attention. Notable exceptions include <span class="citation" data-cites="papavasiliouScarcityPricingMissing2020">Papavasiliou (<a href="#ref-papavasiliouScarcityPricingMissing2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="frewImpactOperatingReserve2021">Frew et al. (<a href="#ref-frewImpactOperatingReserve2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021a</a>)</span>, who briefly discuss the potential for FCS scarcity pricing to better reflect the true value of system reliability and support investment in FCS.</p>
<p>An additional challenge in implementing efficient FCS markets involves the trade-offs that must be considered. As outlined in Section 4.3, some mechanisms that improve efficiency may come at the expense of visibility, control and redundancy afforded to the SO, which typically does not own any FCS-capable assets. The former is typically achieved using market-based mechanisms and the latter through regulatory mechanisms. <span class="citation" data-cites="elaAlternativeApproachesIncentivizing2012">Ela et al. (<a href="#ref-elaAlternativeApproachesIncentivizing2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012b</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020">Billimoria et al.

(<a href="#ref-lalEssentialSystemServices2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> discuss several prerequisites for implementing market-based mechanisms and stress that balance between market-based and regulatory mechanisms may be required. However, achieving this balance can be challenging due to the asymmetry between the risk of an event and its consequences, and that between the benefits of market efficiency and the cost of resilient and robust mitigation measures <span class="citation" data-cites="mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021 lalEssentialSystemServices2021">(<a href="#ref-lalEssentialSystemServices2021" role="doc-biblioref">Lal et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021" role="doc-biblioref">Mancarella and Billimoria, 2021</a>)</span>. Another trade-off is the arbitrary definition of FCS products. Market-based mechanisms will work best when FCS are "discrete" commodities and fungible. However, this ignores the wide “spectrum” of resource technical capabilities. Favouring fungibility may obscure physical and control interdependencies between FCS and restrict or fail to incentivise higher quality provision, thereby leading to an inefficient overall outcome <span class="citation" data-cites="gimonGridPhysicsMarkets2020 macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020">(<a href="#ref-gimonGridPhysicsMarkets2020" role="doc-biblioref">Gimon, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020" role="doc-biblioref">MacGill and Esplin, 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.5.1" id="overview-of-the-nem"><span class="header-section-number">6.5.1</span> Overview of the NEM</h3>
<p>The NEM consists of five regions corresponding to the eastern and southern Australian states of New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD), Victoria (VIC), South Australia (SA) and Tasmania (TAS) (Figure 8). In 2020, the NEM serviced a total electricity consumption of approximately 190 TWh/year and a peak demand of approximately 35 GW across a ‘stringy’ network over 5000 kilometres long with relatively weak interconnection between regions through interconnectors <span class="citation" data-cites="macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020 australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Regulator, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020" role="doc-biblioref">MacGill and Esplin, 2020</a>)</span>. As high voltage DC transmission connects the island of Tasmania to the mainland state of Victoria, the NEM consists of two synchronous areas operated at a nominal frequency of 50 Hz: the mainland states and Tasmania. Due to the large distances involved, the NEM is not electrically connected to other markets.</p>

</figure>
<p>The NEM is a single platform (real-time) energy-only market with no explicit capacity mechanisms. Unit commitment is managed by market participants, who must submit resource-specific offers for energy and Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) capacity in price-quantity pairs the day before delivery. These offers are subsequently used in a pre-dispatch process, which provides forecasted market information (e.g. generation and demand, interconnector flows, prices, etc.) to market participants. While prices in submitted offers are fixed, participants may change the energy volumes in their offer up to a few minutes before the delivery dispatch interval commences. As the NEM is single-sided, security-constrained economic dispatch is run every five minute to meet forecast demand at least cost, subject to network and security constraints. Much like ISO/RTO markets, energy and FCAS markets are co-optimised with respect to technical feasibility and cost <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorFCASModelNEMDE2017 australianenergymarketoperatorDispatchStandardOperating2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorDispatchStandardOperating2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021d</a>, <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFCASModelNEMDE2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017b</a>)</span>. Real-time dispatch produces zonal marginal prices for energy and FCAS, which form the basis for market settlement in each of the NEM’s regions.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.5.2" id="fcas-markets"><span class="header-section-number">6.5.2</span> FCAS markets</h3>
<p>The NEM’s competitive FCAS markets consist of eight separate raise and lower FCAS products that can be classed as regulation FCAS or contingency FCAS, with the former responsible for control when frequency is within the normal operating frequency band (NOFB) and the latter for when frequency deviates outside the NOFB after an event (see Table <strong>¿tbl:fcs-fcas?</strong>). This is similar to arrangements in many ISO/RTO markets, where FCS are divided into event and non-event reserves <span class="citation" data-cites="elaOperatingReservesVariable2011">(<a href="#ref-elaOperatingReservesVariable2011" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Security-constrained economic dispatch includes system-wide and regional FCAS requirement constraints. Regulation and contingency FCAS are typically procured for and from all regions of the NEM in the absence of binding local constraints. Local requirements for FCAS procurement apply to Tasmania and to the other regions of the NEM if they experience network constraints, are at risk of separation or when islanded<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorConstraintFormulationGuidelines2010 australianenergymarketoperatorConstraintImplementationGuidelines2015">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorConstraintImplementationGuidelines2015" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2015a</a>, <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorConstraintFormulationGuidelines2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. Prices are calculated for each region of the NEM based on the sum of the shadow prices of local and system-wide constraints and FCAS costs are allocated to market participants based on a "Causer Pays" principle, which bears similarities to imbalance penalties in European markets <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorGuideAncillaryServices2015">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorGuideAncillaryServices2015" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2015b</a>)</span>.

<p>For a resource to provide FCAS, it must meet pre-qualification criteria and undergo a registration process. Historically, FCAS was provided by thermal generation (predominantly coal and some gas), hydropower generation and some large loads, such as hydropower pumps and an aluminium smelter, as only resources associated with wholesale energy market participants were permitted to offer FCAS. In 2017, the first battery energy storage system (BESS) in the NEM began to offer FCAS and market reform enabled demand response (DR) aggregators to offer contingency FCAS without participating in the energy market <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionNationalElectricityAmendment2016 aureconLargeScaleBatteryStorage2019">(<a href="#ref-aureconLargeScaleBatteryStorage2019" role="doc-biblioref">Aurecon, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionNationalElectricityAmendment2016" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2016</a>)</span>.

<p>The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is responsible for the operation of the market and power system in the NEM in accordance with the National Electricity Rules (NER). They act as a single buyer of dynamically-determined volumes of FCS. The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) is responsible for making or amending rules for the NEM. Both AEMO and the AEMC provide operational and strategic advice to the Energy Security Board (ESB), which is responsible for coordinating market oversight and longer-term reform such as the ongoing post-2025 NEM market design framework.

<p>The rapid pace at which IBR have entered the NEM was preceded by the exit of FCAS-capable synchronous generation (Figure 9). Many of these IBR do not currently offer FCAS or any meaningful frequency response to deviations other than the most extreme. Furthermore, though updated equipment standards require distributed IBR to ride-through and/or respond to certain frequency deviations, some inverter models have been found to be non-compliant and there is still a significant number of legacy systems in the NEM <span class="citation" data-cites="stringerConsumerLedTransitionAustralia2020 australianenergymarketoperatorBehaviourDistributedResources2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorBehaviourDistributedResources2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021f</a>; <a href="#ref-stringerConsumerLedTransitionAustralia2020" role="doc-biblioref">Stringer et al., 2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The challenges that VRE and other IBR pose to frequency control have been exacerbated by the NEM’s network topology.

<li>PFR from contingency FCAS is only required to respond to frequency deviations outside the NOFB (50 <span class="math inline">\pm</span> 0.15 Hz). When FCAS markets were implemented in the NEM in 2001, mandatory PFR around a tight deadband of <span class="math inline">\pm</span> 50 mHz was removed from the NER <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019c</a>)</span>. Since then and prior to 2020, there was no explicit procurement or requirement for tight-deadband PFR provision within the NOFB. The decline in the provision of tight-deadband PFR in the NEM is discussed further in Section 4.6.1.</li>
<li>The mainland synchronous area is controlled as one balancing area by AEMO’s AGC (i.e. no tie-line biased SFR) despite limited interconnection between adjacent regions <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorAEMCFrequencyControl2018">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorAEMCFrequencyControl2018" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2018a</a>)</span>.

Furthermore, regulation and contingency FCAS products are unbundled into raise and lower services, and contingency FCAS products are unbundled based on response time. All of these features improve the potential for participation and competition in FCAS markets, though market participants can and often are enabled to provide multiple FCAS.</li>
<li>FCAS unbundling has enabled a ‘Causer Pays’ cost allocation framework. Raise contingency FCAS costs, which are incurred as insurance for the failure of a generator, are distributed amongst generators in proportion to their generation in the trading interval. Similarly, lower contingency FCAS costs are distributed amongst loads based on their consumption in a trading interval. A complex methodology is used to calculate monthly, portfolio-wide Causer Pays contribution factors (outlined in <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorRegulationFCASContribution2018a">Australian Energy Market Operator (<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRegulationFCASContribution2018a" role="doc-biblioref">2018b</a>)</span> and summarised in <span class="citation" data-cites="rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015">Riesz et al.

<p>In light of existing challenges and those posed by energy transition, effective and efficient frequency control arrangements should enable sufficient FCS to be procured across timeframes and strike the appropriate balance between efficiency and robustness. In the following sections, we review issues associated with two core elements of the NEM’s frequency control hierarchy (i.e. PFR and SFR), assess their physical and economic performance and outline reform underway. Drawing on developments in the NEM and our review of arrangements in North America and Europe, we then discuss the merits and flaws of regulatory and market-based mechanisms with respect to sufficiency and efficiency. We conclude by offering insights that could serve as design principles for jurisdictions revisiting their frequency control arrangements during energy transition.</p>

<p>When FCAS markets were implemented in 2001, mandatory tight-deadband PFR was superseded by two types of PFR: voluntary PFR within the NOFB and competitive procurement for PFR outside the NOFB in the form of contingency FCAS <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019c</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As such, the NEM’s frequency control scheme deviated from what has been argued to be international best practice as it only explicitly specified and procured wide-deadband PFR (i.e. deadband of <span class="math inline">\pm</span> 150 mHz) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019c</a>)</span>.

<p>In recent years in the NEM, the lack of an incentive or requirement for tight-deadband PFR and perceived disincentives to its provision (through Causer Pays contribution factors discussed further in Section 4.6.2) has led to many synchronous generators that once provided tight-deadband PFR to widen deadbands or install control systems that block or dampen PFR from the speed governor within the NOFB <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2020b</a>)</span>. Furthermore, many VRE generators were deployed in the NEM and connected with inverter control systems that were unresponsive to any frequency deviations other than the most serious.</p>
<p>The extent to which tight-deadband PFR provision had declined in the NEM and the consequences of this became clear to AEMO following a major power system incident on the 25<sup>th</sup> of August 2018 <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorFinalReportQueensland2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFinalReportQueensland2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019d</a>)</span>. Prior to the event, the QLD region was exporting <span class="math inline">\sim</span> 900 MW to the rest of the NEM. Around 13:11:41, lightning strikes at the QLD-NSW interconnector resulted in the QLD region being separated from the rest of the NEM with excess supply. The SA region was exporting <span class="math inline">\sim</span> 200 MW prior to the event and following QLD’s separation, this increased by more than 200 MW in response to under-frequency. The sudden increase in active power flow triggered an emergency scheme that disconnected SA from the NSW-VIC synchronous area, resulting in local over-frequency.</p>
<p>There were diverse responses from various generators following the double separation event. While many synchronous generators provided some form of PFR though not enabled for FCAS, their response was withdrawn by their load controllers in several cases so that the unit could return to its dispatch target (e.g. green and pink lines in top frame of Figure 10). Wind and solar farms were either unresponsive, tripped due to protection settings in their inverters, or reduced their active power output in line with performance standards negotiated in their connection agreements (middle and bottom frames in Figure 10). AEMO attributed slow frequency recovery and under-frequency load shedding in NSW and VIC to insufficient PFR from generators and a lack of appropriate contingency FCAS within the islanded regions. Over 50% of fast and slow raise contingency FCAS needed in NSW-VIC was enabled in SA and QLD, whilst QLD had no lower FCAS enabled to respond to over-frequency<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorFinalReportQueensland2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFinalReportQueensland2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019d</a>)</span>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Prior to this incident, deteriorating control of frequency within the NOFB was of concern to AEMO and the AEMC, and trials and investigations were recommended to inform the design of an incentive for tight-deadband PFR provision <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2018b</a>)</span>. However, this separation event demonstrated the “urgent need for regulatory changes to arrest the ongoing decline in frequency performance in the NEM” and to enhance “the resilience of the NEM to similar major disturbances”, with AEMO submitting a rule change proposal for all capable generators in the NEM to provide mandatory PFR with a maximum deadband of <span class="math inline">\pm</span> 0.015 Hz (i.e. 10% of the NOFB) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019c</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This rule was initially incorporated into the NER in 2020 as a temporary arrangement through the addition of a “sunset” after three years to demonstrate the AEMC’s commitment to investigating incentives or market-based mechanisms for tight-deadband PFR <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2020 australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlRule2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2020b</a>, <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlRule2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020c</a>)</span>.

<p>For SFR provided by regulation FCAS within the NOFB to be effective, the dynamics of the system need to accommodate slower SFR control action and the centralised secondary controller (in the NEM, AEMO’s AGC) needs to be properly configured. Prior to the introduction of mandatory PFR in the NEM, AEMO observed no significant improvement in NOFB frequency stability despite several increases in the minimum volumes procured for regulation FCAS in 2019 <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019c</a>)</span>. This is likely due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of fast and decentralised tight-deadband PFR supporting slower SFR;</li>
<li>Inappropriate control signals being calculated within the AGC due to the use of rate limiters to account for ramping constraints, signal filtering and generator controller models that do not accurately reflect a unit’s frequency response <span class="citation" data-cites="digsilentReviewFrequencyControl2017">(<a href="#ref-digsilentReviewFrequencyControl2017" role="doc-biblioref">DIgSILENT, 2017</a>)</span>. The latter is the consequence of an absence of control coordination between market participants and AEMO; and</li>
<li>Variable communication delays between individual unit controllers and AEMO’s AGC system, and disparate response times from generators.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the control of all mainland regions as one balancing area can be problematic in the event of separation. AGC control of regulation FCAS enabled in islanded regions may exacerbate local frequency deviations when responding to the AGC frequency reference. This was the case during the double separation event on the 25<sup>th</sup> of August 2018, in which the AGC instructed raise regulation FCAS generators in QLD and SA to respond to under-frequency in the AGC frequency reference despite local over-frequency (Figure 11). Such incorrect control action can occur until AEMO is able to manually reconfigure the AGC to treat each island as a control area - a process which can take up to 15 minutes <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorFinalReportQueensland2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFinalReportQueensland2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019d</a>)</span> .</p>

<p>Over time, inefficiencies in regulation FCAS procurement and cost-allocation have also become apparent.

Given that time error is no longer prioritised as a control objective, dynamic regulation FCAS procurement based on better measures of sustained frequency deviation (e.g. mean absolute error as suggested by <span class="citation" data-cites="rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015">Riesz et al.

<p>Regulation FCAS costs are allocated to market participants based on their contribution factor, a calculation which represents the extent to which the participant has contributed to the need for regulation FCAS through a deviation from a dispatch trajectory. Though the calculation methodology assigns weights to a generator or load’s dispatch trajectory deviation based on the AGC regulation direction and mileage requirement every 4 seconds, the disincentive for dispatch deviation suffers from a disconnect to causation. This is because the contribution factors of a generator or load are averaged over a 5-minute dispatch interval, summed over a 28-day period and then within a market participant’s portfolio <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorRegulationFCASContribution2018a australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018 australianenergyregulatorIssuesPaperSemi2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2018b</a>; <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRegulationFCASContribution2018a" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2018b</a>; <a href="#ref-australianenergyregulatorIssuesPaperSemi2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Regulator, 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Much like portfolio-based balancing in Europe, the aggregation of contribution factors enables a market participant to offset antagonistic deviations with assisting deviations (from the provision of tight-deadband PFR) across its resources and time. However, the complexity and opacity of the methodology and cost-allocation process has contributed to the withdrawal of tight-deadband PFR in the NEM.

<p>Though the introduction of competitive FCAS markets in 2001 initially resulted in significantly lower FCAS prices in the NEM <span class="citation" data-cites="thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007 rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015">(<a href="#ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015" role="doc-biblioref">Riesz et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007" role="doc-biblioref">Thorncraft and Outhred, 2007</a>)</span>, volume-weighted average FCAS prices, particularly those for raise regulation and contingency services, have increased relative to the volume-weighted average energy price since 2016 (Figure 12). Furthermore, the increases in minimum regulation FCAS volumes and reductions in assumed load relief in 2019 have raised the procured volumes of regulation and contingency FCAS, respectively.

<p>Prior to the implementation of mandatory PFR, higher NEM FCAS costs were arguably not accompanied by an improvement in frequency control performance. Alongside deteriorating frequency control performance within the NOFB (Figure 13), AEMO has expressed a loss of confidence in the NEM’s resilience to complex power system events, such as the double separation incident on the 25<sup>th</sup> of August 2018 <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019c</a>)</span>.

<p>Since the implementation of the mandatory PFR, settings specified by AEMO have been applied to a majority of large synchronous generators (<span class="math inline">&gt;</span> 200MW) and some smaller synchronous generators. Despite the absence of requirements for maintaining headroom and/or footroom, preliminary analysis by AEMO<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> suggests that mandatory PFR has delivered better control of frequency within the NOFB (see Figure 14) and reduced excursions beyond the NOFB <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorEnduringPrimaryFrequency2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021a</a>)</span>. As a result of this initial success and further technical advice provided by AEMO, the AEMC has indicated that it intends to retain mandatory PFR at a tight-deadband following the “sunset” of the initial rule <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionPrimaryFrequencyResponse2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionPrimaryFrequencyResponse2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2021a</a>)</span>.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, this initial success may be a result of the headroom maintained by these generators for risk management purposes (e.g. defending contract positions) and any headroom made available to the system through the displacement of more expensive synchronous capacity by VRE. Given that several large synchronous generators are expected to retire in the coming decades <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperator2020IntegratedSystem2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020IntegratedSystem2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020h</a>)</span>, continuing to rely on this “free” headroom (and any available footroom) into the future may reduce the potential resilience benefits of widespread, tight-deadband PFR and place a greater burden on generators that do reserve headroom and hence respond. The AEMC is proposing to address this issue by paying resources that provide assisting tight-deadband PFR (“double-siding”) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionPrimaryFrequencyResponse2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionPrimaryFrequencyResponse2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2021a</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Presently, several other operational and market changes are being considered or implemented with the goal of improving the effectiveness of arrangements in the NEM. AEMO is investigating the use of dispatch constraints to <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorFrequencyControlWork2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFrequencyControlWork2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021g</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Procure contingency FCAS volumes based on system inertia;</li>
<li>Apply regional contingency and regulation FCAS requirements; and</li>
<li>To limit the amount of switched contingency FCAS procured. Switched FCAS has a number of limitations compared to governor-like control <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020c">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020c" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020g</a>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These additional constraints will likely improve the effectiveness of frequency control arrangements but may lead to higher FCAS costs. In addition to these procurement changes, the AEMC has made a rule to introduce raise and lower contingency markets for FFR by October 2023, each with a likely response time of 1 second <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorFastFrequencyResponse2021 australianenergymarketcommissionFastFrequencyResponse2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFastFrequencyResponse2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2021b</a>; <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorFastFrequencyResponse2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021h</a>)</span>. Whilst AEMO has highlighted that potential stability issues and interconnector maloperation will need to be managed (e.g. through delivery caps or provision constraints) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorImplementationNationalElectricity2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorImplementationNationalElectricity2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021i</a>)</span>, these FFR markets, along with the ESB’s proposals for short-term scheduling and/or procurement of inertial response <span class="citation" data-cites="energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021">(<a href="#ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021" role="doc-biblioref">Energy Security Board, 2021a</a>)</span>, will likely improve AEMO’s operational toolbox for managing a low-inertia NEM.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.6.4" id="reactive-regulatory-requirements"><span class="header-section-number">6.6.4</span> Reactive regulatory requirements</h3>
<p>Despite a broad set of FCS markets, there is a high degree of reliance on regulatory mechanisms in the NEM. Performance standards and mandatory PFR enforced by connection requirements in the NEM have recently been aligned with international grid-codes <span class="citation" data-cites="robertsReviewInternationalGrid2018">(<a href="#ref-robertsReviewInternationalGrid2018" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts, 2018</a>)</span>. As argued by TNSPs and AEMO during the mandatory PFR rule change process, near-universal widespread provision of frequency control should lead to relatively low costs for individual participants and be outweighed by greater visibility and certainty for AEMO alongside the system-wide benefits of improved physical frequency control performance <span class="citation" data-cites="hopwoodMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019 dillonMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019 australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorElectricityRuleChange2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019c</a>; <a href="#ref-dillonMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019" role="doc-biblioref">Dillon, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-hopwoodMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hopwood, 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Regulatory mechanisms are ideal for mandating basic FCS capabilities as a condition for access, which may reduce the need to procure more specialised FCS, or where FCS faces significant barriers to efficient price formation or unbundled procurement. The latter reasons are particularly pertinent in the NEM. Current FCAS prices do not appear to be incentivising FCS provision from the vast majority of VRE generators, which have business models centred around energy provision <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionReserveServicesNational2021 meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionReserveServicesNational2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2021c</a>; <a href="#ref-meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021" role="doc-biblioref">Meegahapola et al., 2021</a>)</span>. Furthermore, procuring inertial response is challenging due to its inseparability from system strength provision and unit commitment costs <span class="citation" data-cites="billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020">(<a href="#ref-billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020" role="doc-biblioref">Billimoria et al., 2020</a>)</span>. With respect to these challenges, regulatory mechanisms in the NEM have assisted in ensuring some level of frequency response from most power system resources (e.g. mandatory PFR) and improving the ability of AEMO and TNSPs to coordinate the procurement of essential but “lumpy” FCS (e.g. inertia shortfall mechanism).</p>
<p>While mechanisms such as mandatory PFR are likely to improve the robustness of frequency control arrangements, it may be difficult for other regulatory mechanisms to keep in step with changing physical performance requirements in systems rapidly facing higher penetrations of VRE and IBR. Regulatory mechanisms are often only updated after a number of years to reduce the burden placed on connecting resources. As such, they are slow to respond to changing capabilities and requirements. This delay often makes new standards and requirements reactive rather than proactive. For example, AEMO can only review utility-scale generator technical performance standards every 5 years <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionGeneratorTechnicalPerformance2018">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionGeneratorTechnicalPerformance2018" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2018a</a>)</span>, a timeframe in which the solar PV capacity installed in the NEM has more than quadrupled (2015-2020) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianpvinstituteInstalledPVGeneration">(<a href="#ref-australianpvinstituteInstalledPVGeneration" role="doc-biblioref">Australian PV Institute, n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Additional concerns with regulatory mechanisms include poor dynamic efficiency and opaque costs<span class="citation" data-cites="rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015">(<a href="#ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015" role="doc-biblioref">Riesz et al., 2015</a>)</span>. In the absence of remuneration or incentives, particularly those that are linked to the quality of frequency response, there is no incentive to innovate or invest in higher-quality frequency control capabilities <span class="citation" data-cites="meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021">(<a href="#ref-meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021" role="doc-biblioref">Meegahapola et al., 2021</a>)</span>. Furthermore, cost opacity may lead to FCS provision costs being internalised within other prices (e.g. energy) by participants and prevent the implementation of imbalance or dispatch non-conformance disincentives through cost-allocation mechanisms.</p>
<h3 data-number="6.6.5" id="preference-for-market-based-arrangements"><span class="header-section-number">6.6.5</span> Preference for market-based arrangements</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the NEM, a competition norm has been established, with markets being viewed as a key driver for delivering the National Electricity Objective of “efficient investment in, and efficient operation and use of electricity services” <span class="citation" data-cites="hainesEnvironmentalNormsElectricity2016 macgillElectricityMarketNorms2020">(<a href="#ref-hainesEnvironmentalNormsElectricity2016" role="doc-biblioref">Haines and McConnell, 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-macgillElectricityMarketNorms2020" role="doc-biblioref">MacGill et al., 2020a</a>)</span>. This norm has pervaded all levels of participation and governance in the NEM. Generator owners opposed the mandatory nature of the mandatory PFR rule change on the basis that a lack of remuneration was against market principles and that it would lead to economically inefficient outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="skinnerMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019 rolfeMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019 scottMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019">(<a href="#ref-rolfeMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019" role="doc-biblioref">Rolfe, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-scottMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019" role="doc-biblioref">Scott, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-skinnerMandatoryPrimaryFrequency2019" role="doc-biblioref">Skinner, 2019</a>)</span>. AEMO did not include a headroom requirement in its proposal, making the mandatory PFR rule change more palatable to market bodies and participants. The AEMC, who have expressed a clear preference for market-based approaches <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2018b</a>)</span>, included a “sunset” clause in their initial decision to implement mandatory PFR. Furthermore, a market for FFR will be implemented in 2023 and the ESB’s post-2025 market design process is considering new system services markets for inertial response and TFR <span class="citation" data-cites="energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021 energysecurityboardPost2025Market2020">(<a href="#ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021" role="doc-biblioref">Energy Security Board, 2021a</a>, <a href="#ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>If incentives or remuneration are designed correctly, markets can drive short-run efficiency. Where required, they can also support investment in FCS capability and assist a power system in achieving dynamically efficient frequency control arrangements. However, in some cases, simply introducing new FCS markets may serve as ‘patchwork’ solutions to existing control deficiencies and market failures. These deficiencies and failures could be partially addressed by improving FCS cost allocation processes, verifying FCS performance and linking incentives to higher quality provision.</p>
<p>As discussed in [Section 4.4), efficient Causer Pays cost-allocation mechanisms in FCS markets could provide suitable disincentives for dispatch non-conformance or imbalances. In the NEM, the aggregation of regulation FCAS Causer Pays contribution factors over time and a portfolio has resulted in a blunt frequency performance market signal. The solution to this problem may not be as simple as strengthening disincentives (e.g. as proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015">Hirth and Ziegenhagen (<a href="#ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="papavasiliouScarcityPricingMissing2020">Papavasiliou (<a href="#ref-papavasiliouScarcityPricingMissing2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>) for resource-based cost-allocation processes as potential exposure to high instantaneous FCS costs may lead to participants curtailing or decommitting flexible resources rather than providing an assisting frequency response. This has been observed in the NEM when local constraints have resulted in regulation FCAS <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlFrameworks2018" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2018b</a>)</span> and contingency FCAS <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorQuarterlyEnergyDynamics2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorQuarterlyEnergyDynamics2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020n</a>)</span> price spikes. The AEMC has proposed a compromise to this problem by shortening the settlement period for regulation FCAS Causer Pays to 5 minutes but only allocating the costs of regulation FCAS capacity that is activated by AEMO (i.e. the cost of any unactivated capacity is socialised across power system users) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionPrimaryFrequencyResponse2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionPrimaryFrequencyResponse2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2021a</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>An alternative to Causer Pays is to allocate costs based on needs (‘User Pays’), such that connected equipment imposing RoCoF or frequency constraints pay for FCS. ‘Users’ of frequency control currently include synchronous machines and IBR that have not been configured to ride-through higher RoCoFs and greater frequency deviations. Following more extreme frequency deviations, the former may suffer equipment damage whereas both have the potential to trip <span class="citation" data-cites="dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016 millerAdvisoryEquipmentLimits2017">(<a href="#ref-dgaconsultingInternationalReviewFrequency2016" role="doc-biblioref">DGA Consulting, 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-millerAdvisoryEquipmentLimits2017" role="doc-biblioref">Miller et al., 2017a</a>)</span>. A User Pays approach to cost-allocation could encourage resources to be more resilient to frequency deviations and thereby reduce system FCS costs <span class="citation" data-cites="lalEssentialSystemServices2021">(<a href="#ref-lalEssentialSystemServices2021" role="doc-biblioref">Lal et al., 2021</a>)</span>, particularly if a significant proportion of connected equipment are IBR that can be configured to ride-through such disturbances.</p>
<p>Beyond choosing who costs should be allocated to and what an appropriate granularity for cost-allocation might be, market designers should ensure that the chosen methodology is transparent, can be understood by participants and that any calculations can be replicated using accessible data. If appropriate design choices are made, efficient cost-allocation could create counter-parties for financial instruments that hedge price risk <span class="citation" data-cites="thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007 skinnerIncorporatingNewPower2020">(<a href="#ref-skinnerIncorporatingNewPower2020" role="doc-biblioref">Skinner et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-thorncraftExperienceMarketbasedAncillary2007" role="doc-biblioref">Thorncraft and Outhred, 2007</a>)</span>. FCS derivatives may drive investment in FCS capabilities by supporting business models in which FCS is a major revenue stream (this is currently the case for utility-scale BESS, DR aggregators and virtual power plants in the NEM) and assist in FCS price formation <span class="citation" data-cites="pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019 billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020">(<a href="#ref-billimoriaMarketDesignSystem2020" role="doc-biblioref">Billimoria et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019" role="doc-biblioref">Pollitt and Anaya, 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As in ISO/RTO Regulation markets, aligning FCS procurement and/or remuneration with performance essentially recognises that there is a spectrum of FCS capabilities. This recognition is lacking in the NEM, where battery energy storage systems are responding precisely and rapidly to AGC regulation signals but are being paid the same as thermal plant that provide lower quality regulation FCAS <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorInitialOperationHornsdale2018">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorInitialOperationHornsdale2018" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2018d</a>)</span>. However, implementing performance-based design is contingent on the SO verifying FCS provision. While AEMO has outlined FCAS delivery measurement standards and verification principles <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorMarketAncillaryService2020a">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorMarketAncillaryService2020a" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020i</a>)</span>, delivery verification appears to be restricted to confirming contingency FCAS delivery following a power system event (to the authors’ best knowledge). While a regular verification process does not appear to be in place for regulation FCAS, AEMO is proposing to specify minimum control requirements (e.g. response delay and ramp rate) and implement a regular testing cycle for resources registered for regulation FCAS <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorAmendmentMarketAncillary2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorAmendmentMarketAncillary2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021j</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Market designers may also need to consider price formation in FCS markets to ensure that arrangements are at least capable of supporting investment during energy transition. As discussed by <span class="citation" data-cites="hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015">Hirth and Ziegenhagen (<a href="#ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, VRE have low to no short-term energy market opportunity-costs when providing lower/negative FCS but can incur significant short-term energy market opportunity-costs when providing raise/positive FCS. The raise/positive opportunity-cost may be even higher if the SO requires additional curtailment to better ensure that FCS capacity is firm, which AEMO has required, or if the resource has entered into an energy off-take agreement, which is common in the NEM <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorHornsdaleWindFarm2018">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorHornsdaleWindFarm2018" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2018e</a>)</span>. While co-optimised FCS markets mean that such opportunity-costs can be accounted for, FCS prices can be suppressed if large conventional generators with low to no opportunity-costs offer large volumes of FCS. Low prices can limit the incentive for high capital, low operating cost IBR to provide and invest in FCS capabilities. This may lead to a dynamically inefficient outcome as additional conventional generators are retired and limited FCS capabilities are offered by VRE and other IBR <span class="citation" data-cites="elaFutureElectricityMarkets2019 meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021">(<a href="#ref-elaFutureElectricityMarkets2019" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-meegahapolaPowerSystemStability2021" role="doc-biblioref">Meegahapola et al., 2021</a>)</span>. As discussed in Section 4.4.3.2, one potential solution to this issue is to strengthen scarcity pricing in FCS markets. The AEMC and ESB have discussed implementing system demand curves with scarcity pricing for all existing and proposed FCAS <span class="citation" data-cites="energysecurityboardPost2025Market2020 australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlRule2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionFrequencyControlRule2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2020c</a>; <a href="#ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2020" role="doc-biblioref">Energy Security Board, 2020b</a>)</span>. However, the shape of these system demand curves and how they account for interdependent or interchangeable FCAS will ultimately dictate their success.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.7" id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">6.7</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Whilst recent years have seen increasing participation from demand response and IBR, energy transition and a pervasive competition norm have exposed design issues in the NEM’s frequency control arrangements. As such, considerable attention and effort have been devoted to reforming the NEM’s arrangements in the past two years.</p>
<p>From our review of North American and European frequency control arrangements and our analysis of the NEM’s, we share four key insights below that could serve as design principles for operators, regulators and market-bodies attempting to design effective and efficient frequency control arrangements in restructured electricity industries during energy transition:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Control deficiencies may not be addressable through introducing new FCS. While this solution may address emerging needs (e.g. low-inertia operation), SOs and market bodies need to better understand the interdependency, interoperability and interchangeability between FCS and the interactions with other technical attributes of the power system (e.g. system strength) to ensure that frequency control is first and foremost effective. Once this has been achieved, the short-run efficiency of arrangements can be improved through mechanisms such as dynamic and probabilistic dimensioning and co-optimising the procurement of interchangeable FCS.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the pace and scale of energy transition, a dynamically efficient outcome in some power systems may require additional investments in FCS capability. FCS prices can be strengthened through scarcity pricing, which may better reflect the system’s preference for security and reliability. Such pricing mechanisms are complementary to appropriate and efficient cost-allocation based on causation or needs. Both efficient price formation and cost-allocation will improve the potential for FCS derivatives, which may assist in providing price signals for investment.</p></li>
<li><p>SOs should systematically and frequently verify FCS delivery, where relevant, and withhold or penalise remuneration when delivery is deemed to be insufficient. If such monitoring is in place, FCS remuneration can be performance-based to drive the provision of high quality FCS. Performance monitoring would also enable the SO to assess FCS arrangements and identify any deficiencies in control action or procurement.</p></li>
<li><p>During energy transition, a suitable set of frequency control arrangements will most likely involve a combination of market-based and regulatory mechanisms. Frequency control is a power system public good and achieving frequency stability requires a degree of coordination and cooperation between resources. These characteristics make it difficult to establish complete markets for FCS, and an emphasis on market solutions may obscure these characteristics to market participants and undermine effective control. In contrast, regulatory mechanisms may prove to be more robust and resilient in the face of uncertainties, particularly those that are exogenous to the power system (e.g. climate risk). Regardless of whether arrangements are skewed towards market-based mechanisms or regulatory mechanisms, designers should be more forward-looking and avoid assumptions regarding the provision of FCS capability over time, particularly when there is a pervasive competition norm and effective frequency control relies on sequential and hierarchical control actions.</p></li>

<p>In wholesale electricity markets, market participation decisions determine the type and quantity of balancing flexibility available within scheduling timeframes. Empirical studies are required to examine whether decentralised operational balancing practices, such as markets, are purpose-fit to deliver the balancing flexibility requirements of electricity markets in transition. Assessing existing arrangements and the need for new markets for flexibility is critical as simply implementing the latter (e.g. a new reserve product market) can introduce additional costs, constraints and complexity and even encroach upon the functions of existing operational practices. This chapter focuses on understanding the balancing flexibility capabilities available in scheduling timeframes both now and into the near future, and using this knowledge to inform market design. The purpose of this chapter is to address the second research objective of this thesis:</p>

<h2 data-number="7.2" id="abstract-2"><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Abstract</h2>
<p>Across several power systems with market frameworks, policy-makers are proposing that balancing flexibility requirements emerging during energy transition be addressed through new reserve product markets. However, these may introduce additional costs, constraints and complexity and even encroach upon the functions of existing operational practices. Thus, policy-makers need to assess and compare flexibility design options, and quantifying system flexibility capabilities based on current and expected resource mixes can assist in achieving this. In this article, we offer a practical method to quantify the time-varying spectrum of upwards and downwards flexibility capabilities in systems, and subsequently apply it to historical and projected resource mixes in two regions of the Australian National Electricity Market. Our results suggest that with higher penetrations of renewable energy: 1) downwards flexibility margins can be exhausted around noon if wind and solar are unable or unwilling to provide it, 2) upwards flexibility becomes more scarce during morning and evening peak demand events and 3) a greater portion of upwards flexibility is provided by energy-limited resources. Given these trends, we recommend that policy-makers examine how existing operational practices can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility provision, and that duration specifications and sustained footroom procurement be considered for reserve products.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.3" id="sec:reserves-intro"><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The reliable and secure operation of power systems is contingent upon locational and temporal balancing of active power supply and demand. As jurisdictions progressively decarbonise electricity supply through considerable capacity additions of variable renewable energy (VRE) and the retirement of carbon-intensive conventional generation, the nature of short-term risks to system balancing (i.e. those of concern over the range of seconds to days) is changing. The most notable of these short-term risks are <span class="citation" data-cites="elaOperatingReservesVariable2011">(<a href="#ref-elaOperatingReservesVariable2011" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2011</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power system <em>variability</em>, which includes expected changes in the supply-demand balance. Traditionally, variability has been associated with system load movements and fluctuations around pre-determined generator schedules. As energy transition proceeds, system operators (SOs) are becoming increasingly focused on managing variability that arises due to the presence of VRE. This includes the correlated ramping of neighbouring solar PV generation during sunrise and sunset, and that of wind generation following the arrival of a cold front <span class="citation" data-cites="lewWesternWindSolar2013 australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020d</a>; <a href="#ref-lewWesternWindSolar2013" role="doc-biblioref">Lew et al., 2013</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>Power system <em>uncertainty</em>, which encompasses unexpected changes in the supply-demand balance. Beyond demand and VRE generation forecast errors, uncertainty also includes singular or widespread outage events that could be the result of a sudden loss of primary energy availability, equipment malfunctions, or common mode failures either triggered by insecure system operation (e.g. significant frequency and/or voltage deviations) or exogenous events (e.g. extreme weather events) <span class="citation" data-cites="redefiningresourceadequacytaskforceRedefiningResourceAdequacy2021 matevosyanFutureInverterBasedResources2021 electricitysectorclimateinformationprojectESCIProjectFinal2021">(<a href="#ref-electricitysectorclimateinformationprojectESCIProjectFinal2021" role="doc-biblioref">Electricity Sector Climate Information Project, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-matevosyanFutureInverterBasedResources2021" role="doc-biblioref">Matevosyan et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-redefiningresourceadequacytaskforceRedefiningResourceAdequacy2021" role="doc-biblioref">Redefining Resource Adequacy Task Force, 2021</a>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Provided that it is sufficient, leveraging the active power balancing flexibility of a power system (defined by <span class="citation" data-cites="heggartyQuantifyingPowerSystem2020">Heggarty et al. (<a href="#ref-heggartyQuantifyingPowerSystem2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> as a system’s “ability to cope with variability and uncertainty”) should enable these short-term risks to be managed. At a particular point in time, the total balancing flexibility <em>capability</em> of a power system is the sum of potential flexibility contributions from resources such as generators, flexible demand and energy storage. However, the flexibility that can actually be <em>deployed</em> at any given time and location is potentially limited by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Physical, economic, social and environmental constraints on the operation of resources <span class="citation" data-cites="denholmHowLowCan2018 gonzalez-salazarReviewOperationalFlexibility2018">(<a href="#ref-denholmHowLowCan2018" role="doc-biblioref">Denholm et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-gonzalez-salazarReviewOperationalFlexibility2018" role="doc-biblioref">Gonzalez-Salazar et al., 2018</a>)</span>;</li>
<li>Network topology, particularly if deploying a flexibility solution results in the violation of network constraints <span class="citation" data-cites="lannoyeTransmissionVariableGeneration2015 liuGridMarketServices2021">(<a href="#ref-lannoyeTransmissionVariableGeneration2015" role="doc-biblioref">Lannoye et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-liuGridMarketServices2021" role="doc-biblioref">Liu et al., 2021</a>)</span>; and</li>
<li>Operational practices. These include protocols and tools used by the SO (which is ultimately responsible for maintaining supply-demand balance) and electricity market design in power systems with a market overlay <span class="citation" data-cites="elaWholesaleElectricityMarket2016">(<a href="#ref-elaWholesaleElectricityMarket2016" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2016</a>)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though it is well established that operational practices are crucial to “enabling” balancing flexibility provision <span class="citation" data-cites="hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015 hsiehGridFlexibilityQuiet2017 papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018">(<a href="#ref-hirthBalancingPowerVariable2015" role="doc-biblioref">Hirth and Ziegenhagen, 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-hsiehGridFlexibilityQuiet2017" role="doc-biblioref">Hsieh and Anderson, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018" role="doc-biblioref">Papaefthymiou et al., 2018</a>)</span>, limited attention has been given to assessing the trade-offs between practice changes <span class="citation" data-cites="maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021">(<a href="#ref-maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021" role="doc-biblioref">Mays, 2021</a>)</span>. A typical design choice in power systems with electricity markets is determining whether a balancing function should be performed by the SO, or partially delegated to market participants via market-based mechanisms. Proponents of market-based mechanisms argue that if they are well-designed, their benefit is twofold: appropriate incentives can unlock the efficient utilisation of latent flexibility from existing resources whilst encouraging investment in additional flexibility as a market-signalled need emerges. However, to some extent, desires to maximise market benefits and minimise market distortions need to be weighed against providing the SO with sufficient lead-time and levers to maintain system balance during both normal and extraordinary circumstances <span class="citation" data-cites="roquesMarketDesignGeneration2008 prakashInsightsDesigningEffective2022">(<a href="#ref-prakashInsightsDesigningEffective2022" role="doc-biblioref">Prakash et al., 2022a</a>; <a href="#ref-roquesMarketDesignGeneration2008" role="doc-biblioref">Roques, 2008</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Establishing markets for balancing reserves offers a compromise between SO control and market efficiency <span class="citation" data-cites="ryanVariableGenerationReserves2014 kristovTaleTwoVisions2016">(<a href="#ref-kristovTaleTwoVisions2016" role="doc-biblioref">Kristov et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-ryanVariableGenerationReserves2014" role="doc-biblioref">Ryan et al., 2014</a>)</span>. These enable the SO to set a requirement for, competitively procure and then schedule system <em>headroom</em> (spare generation capacity and potential load curtailment) or system <em>footroom</em> (potential generation curtailment and load increase) with particular power, energy, ramping and quality-of-response (e.g. response time) capabilities <span class="citation" data-cites="ulbigAnalyzingOperationalFlexibility2015 degefaComprehensiveClassificationsCharacterizations2021">(<a href="#ref-degefaComprehensiveClassificationsCharacterizations2021" role="doc-biblioref">Degefa et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-ulbigAnalyzingOperationalFlexibility2015" role="doc-biblioref">Ulbig and Andersson, 2015</a>)</span>. Whilst tailored <em>reserve services</em> can be procured through tendering processes, zonal or system-wide markets for <em>reserve products</em> have become increasingly commonplace given that temporal balancing is of greater concern in meshed networks. Additionally, “commodification” of capabilities through products reduces complexity and enables the implementation of auctions, which can improve transparency and competition and be co-optimised with energy or other reserve product markets <span class="citation" data-cites="mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021 lalEssentialSystemServices2021">(<a href="#ref-lalEssentialSystemServices2021" role="doc-biblioref">Lal et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-mancarellaFragileGridPhysics2021" role="doc-biblioref">Mancarella and Billimoria, 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The changing nature of short-term risks to system balancing and the accompanying need for greater system flexibility is leading policy-makers to reassess the suitability of the reserve products available to their SOs <span class="citation" data-cites="eu-sysflexProductDefinitionInnovative2019 energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021 federalenergyregulatorycommissionEnergyAncillaryServices2021">(<a href="#ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021" role="doc-biblioref">Energy Security Board, 2021a</a>; <a href="#ref-eu-sysflexProductDefinitionInnovative2019" role="doc-biblioref">EU-SysFlex, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-federalenergyregulatorycommissionEnergyAncillaryServices2021" role="doc-biblioref">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 2021</a>)</span>. Reform of reserve arrangements can simply modify procurement practices or lead to a more significant restructuring of available products, which includes introducing new markets <span class="citation" data-cites="ryanVariableGenerationReserves2014">(<a href="#ref-ryanVariableGenerationReserves2014" role="doc-biblioref">Ryan et al., 2014</a>)</span>. Particularly in their initial stages, reform processes tend to justify changes on the basis of how they might address potential threats to system balancing. This approach is appropriate and sufficient where reserve service provision entails specialised quality-of-response capabilities that cannot be provided effectively or efficiently through other means (e.g. high bandwidth control configurations required for fast frequency response provision). However, some reserve products may “compete” with other design options. For example, the purpose and timeframe of tertiary frequency control and ramping products overlap with those of dispatch processes. Where reserve arrangement reform encroaches on the functions of other processes and practices, quantifying system flexibility capabilities based on current and expected resources mixes can assist policy-makers in assessing flexibility design options.</p>
<p>Reserve products also impose tangible and intangible costs. Regardless of cost allocation mechanisms, procuring reserves typically raises system operation costs and thus prices paid by energy users <span class="citation" data-cites="hummonFundamentalDriversCost2013">(<a href="#ref-hummonFundamentalDriversCost2013" role="doc-biblioref">Hummon et al., 2013</a>)</span>. Furthermore, even if they offer a solution to a system sub-problem, reserve products do not guarantee reliable operation of the overall system and may even hinder the implementation of other measures that can realise system flexibility <span class="citation" data-cites="papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018 pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019 macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020">(<a href="#ref-macgillEndtoendElectricityMarket2020" role="doc-biblioref">MacGill and Esplin, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-papaefthymiouPowerSystemFlexibility2018" role="doc-biblioref">Papaefthymiou et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019" role="doc-biblioref">Pollitt and Anaya, 2019</a>)</span>. For example, valuing balancing flexibility on the scale of minutes to hours through reserve products could mean sacrificing the benefits of better reflecting the value of flexibility in energy prices:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For participants, energy market risk management is more straightforward than managing risk in reserve product markets. Short-term energy markets typically have greater depth and a broader range of associated technical or financial forward markets <span class="citation" data-cites="pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019">(<a href="#ref-pollittCompetitionMarketsAncillary2019" role="doc-biblioref">Pollitt and Anaya, 2019</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>Reserve product markets often have pre-qualification criteria and minimum offer quantities. As such, the participation of smaller demand-side and distributed energy resources (DER) in reserve product markets is often contingent on the involvement of an intermediary aggregator, which imposes additional transaction costs <span class="citation" data-cites="poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019">(<a href="#ref-poplavskayaDistributedEnergyResources2019" role="doc-biblioref">Poplavskaya and de Vries, 2019</a>)</span>. However, embedding the value of flexibility within the price for energy could simplify flexibility provision through market participation for these resources, particularly if policy-makers pursue dynamic retail pricing or nested distribution-level markets that interface with transmission-level markets <span class="citation" data-cites="kristovTaleTwoVisions2016 hoganMarketDesignPractices2019 maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021">(<a href="#ref-hoganMarketDesignPractices2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hogan, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-kristovTaleTwoVisions2016" role="doc-biblioref">Kristov et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-maysMissingIncentivesFlexibility2021" role="doc-biblioref">Mays, 2021</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>The flexibility that the SO is able to procure through reserve products is restricted by their product specifications. Solely relying on reserve products for flexibility may constrain operational outcomes. Such flexibility “discretisation” might also be reflected in the resources deployed in the system should reserve product markets influence investment decisions <span class="citation" data-cites="lalEssentialSystemServices2021">(<a href="#ref-lalEssentialSystemServices2021" role="doc-biblioref">Lal et al., 2021</a>)</span>. Additionally, whilst reserve products can be tailored to a particular system’s capabilities and needs, reserve sharing between SO jurisdictions is easier if technical specifications are standardised <span class="citation" data-cites="schererFrequencyControlEuropean2016">(<a href="#ref-schererFrequencyControlEuropean2016" role="doc-biblioref">Scherer, 2016</a>)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given these factors, quantification and comparison are therefore needed to assess the role of reserve products, particularly where <span class="citation" data-cites="reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007 elaElectricityMarketFuture2021">(<a href="#ref-elaElectricityMarketFuture2021" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-reboursFundamentalDesignIssues2007" role="doc-biblioref">Y. Rebours et al., 2007</a>)</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Other operational practice or policy changes have the potential to deliver greater and/or more robust flexibility benefits without the additional costs, uncertainty and complexity of new markets; or</li>
<li>Current market design or exogenous resource adequacy policies (e.g. firming revenue guarantees or capacity markets) are driving sufficient investment in flexible resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>A plethora of metrics that quantify different aspects of system balancing flexibility capabilities have been proposed in the literature <span class="citation" data-cites="lannoyePowerSystemFlexibility2012 mohandesReviewPowerSystem2019 heggartyQuantifyingPowerSystem2020">(<a href="#ref-heggartyQuantifyingPowerSystem2020" role="doc-biblioref">Heggarty et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-lannoyePowerSystemFlexibility2012" role="doc-biblioref">Lannoye et al., 2012a</a>; <a href="#ref-mohandesReviewPowerSystem2019" role="doc-biblioref">Mohandes et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Rather than solely quantifying flexibility capabilities, operational metrics typically compare short-term flexibility capabilities against a flexibility requirement that is set by one of the following or a combination thereof: rules-of-thumb, net load variability, net load forecast uncertainty and/or probabilistic VRE forecasts. While an SO can use these metrics to identify potential flexibility shortages <span class="citation" data-cites="zhaoUnifiedFrameworkDefining2016">(<a href="#ref-zhaoUnifiedFrameworkDefining2016" role="doc-biblioref">Zhao et al., 2016</a>)</span>, dimension reserve products <span class="citation" data-cites="dvorkinAssessingFlexibilityRequirements2014 costilla-enriquezOperatingDynamicReserve2023">(<a href="#ref-costilla-enriquezOperatingDynamicReserve2023" role="doc-biblioref">Costilla-Enriquez et al., 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-dvorkinAssessingFlexibilityRequirements2014" role="doc-biblioref">Dvorkin et al., 2014</a>)</span> or schedule resources <span class="citation" data-cites="nosairFlexibilityEnvelopesPower2015">(<a href="#ref-nosairFlexibilityEnvelopesPower2015" role="doc-biblioref">Nosair and Bouffard, 2015</a>)</span>, they may be less useful to system designers assessing changes to practices that leverage decentralised decision-making (e.g. energy and reserve product markets). Broader planning-oriented flexibility capability metrics may be more suitable for such purposes. These include traditional resource adequacy metrics <span class="citation" data-cites="stenclikQuantifyingRiskUncertain2021">(<a href="#ref-stenclikQuantifyingRiskUncertain2021" role="doc-biblioref">Stenclik et al., 2021</a>)</span>, “inflexibility costs” (e.g. additional system costs due to flexibility constraints as explored in <span class="citation" data-cites="vithayasrichareonOperationalFlexibilityFuture2017">Vithayasrichareon et al.

(<a href="#ref-lannoyeEvaluationPowerSystem2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012b</a>)</span>. In particular, <span class="citation" data-cites="lannoyeEvaluationPowerSystem2012">Lannoye et al. (<a href="#ref-lannoyeEvaluationPowerSystem2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012b</a>)</span> uses time-sequential power system operations data to explicitly calculate the balancing flexibility available after resources are dispatched, though valuable chronological information is lost when the time series generated in the study are converted into probability distributions to calculate the insufficient ramping resource expectation. By retaining a degree of this chronological information, our methodology aims to provide electricity industry stakeholders with a better understanding of the time-varying “spectrum” of system balancing flexibility capabilities, and thus assist them in assessing, comparing and designing potential operational practice changes to improve flexibility in power systems with a growing number of variable and energy-limited resources.</p>
<p>In this article, we offer a practical method for quantifying available reserves and footroom (the balancing flexibility that is available after resources are dispatched to meet system demand), and an example of how such quantification can inform flexible electricity market design. We provide simple extensions to the methodology developed by <span class="citation" data-cites="lannoyeEvaluationPowerSystem2012">Lannoye et al. (<a href="#ref-lannoyeEvaluationPowerSystem2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012b</a>)</span> that account for flexibility contributions from VRE and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and market participants’ aversions to incurring cycling costs. We then use this methodology in a case study in which we quantify time-varying available reserves and footroom in real-world systems: two regions of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Through a 2020 baseline and two 2025 scenarios, we test four key sensitivities in these two regions: the acceleration of large conventional generation retirement, the rate of deployment of VRE and storage technologies, contrasting resource mixes and operational constraints, and greater variability in operational demand. While previous studies have tested the impact of some of these sensitivities on the availability of total system headroom or existing reserve products <span class="citation" data-cites="hummonFundamentalDriversCost2013 tanotoImpactHighSolar2021 frewCurtailmentParadoxTransition2021">(<a href="#ref-frewCurtailmentParadoxTransition2021" role="doc-biblioref">Frew et al., 2021b</a>; <a href="#ref-hummonFundamentalDriversCost2013" role="doc-biblioref">Hummon et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-tanotoImpactHighSolar2021" role="doc-biblioref">Tanoto et al., 2021</a>)</span>, our analysis offers a perspective that is focused on quantifying a time-varying spectrum of flexibility capabilities and thus concerned with the <em>design</em> of operational practices in low-carbon power systems. Our analysis results highlight the underappreciated need to consider mechanisms for procuring footroom, and we proceed to discuss the implications of implementing new balancing products on operational outcomes. Though the NEM is unique in aspects of its operational practices and the balancing risks it faces, the methodology and findings from this study will become increasingly relevant in other jurisdictions given the accelerating deployment of VRE and storage and the progressive retirement of carbon-intensive conventional generation <span class="citation" data-cites="internationalenergyagencyStatusPowerSystem2019 internationalenergyagencyNetZero20502021">(<a href="#ref-internationalenergyagencyNetZero20502021" role="doc-biblioref">International Energy Agency, 2021</a>, <a href="#ref-internationalenergyagencyStatusPowerSystem2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Section 5.4 provides an overview of how balancing flexibility is enabled and procured through the NEM’s operational practices and market design. In Section 5.5, we describe a methodology to quantify available reserves and footroom across deployment horizons for various resource types. Then, in Section 5.6, we quantify the available reserves and footroom in two regions of the NEM for existing resource mixes in 2020 and potential resources mixes in 2025, with two scenarios for the latter. We then use the findings from this case study to explore the role of reserve products in securing balancing flexibility. We conclude by highlighting pertinent findings and recommendations to policy-makers in Section 5.7.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.4" id="sec:reserves-flexnem"><span class="header-section-number">7.4</span> Flexibility in the National Electricity Market</h2>
<p>The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is a short-term wholesale electricity market overlaid on a ~5000 kilometre long “stringy” network that services the majority of eastern and southern Australia <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionElectricitySupplyChain">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionElectricitySupplyChain" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, n.d.b</a>)</span>.

With no explicit capacity mechanisms or compulsory forward markets, the NEM solely consists of a zonal real-time platform, with market regions corresponding to the states of Queensland, New South Wales (NSW), Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia (SA). Interconnection between market regions is relatively weak and, due to the large distances involved, the NEM is not connected to other bulk power systems <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorMaintainingPowerSystem2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorMaintainingPowerSystem2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2019b</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the subsections that follow, we describe the operation of the NEM with a focus on features and mechanisms that enable or explicitly procure balancing flexibility. In particular, we discuss current reserve arrangements in the NEM in Section 5.4.3 and the proposal to introduce an <em>operating reserve</em> product in Section 5.4.3.1. The policy debate surrounding the usefulness and design of this potential reserve product provides the primary motivation for our case study in Section 5.6.</p>

<h4 data-number="7.4.1.1" id="real-time-markets"><span class="header-section-number">7.4.1.1</span> Real-time markets</h4>
<p>The NEM is a central dispatch market that is operated by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO). On the day ahead of delivery, market participants are required to submit non-binding offers for each resource consisting of price-quantity pairs for energy and, optionally, Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) (described in Section Section 5.4.3) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorPredispatchOperatingProcedure2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPredispatchOperatingProcedure2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021k</a>)</span>. Energy offers can be priced as high as the market price cap (15,000 AUD/MW/hour during the Australian financial year of 2020-2021) or as low as the market floor (-1000 AUD/MW/hour). Negative pricing enables generators to express a preference to either remain online due to significant start-up/shut-down costs or to be dispatched as a price-taker when it is commercially favourable to do so (e.g. to receive remuneration from an offtake agreement). In theory, it also provides investment signals for flexible resources alongside a relatively high market price cap <span class="citation" data-cites="rieszAssessingViabilityEnergyonly2016 orvisRefiningCompetitiveElectricity2018">(<a href="#ref-orvisRefiningCompetitiveElectricity2018" role="doc-biblioref">Orvis and Aggarwal, 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-rieszAssessingViabilityEnergyonly2016" role="doc-biblioref">Riesz et al., 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>On the day of delivery, co-optimised markets for energy and FCAS are cleared every 5 minutes through a security-constrained economic dispatch process, which produces zonal marginal prices for energy and FCAS. There is no formal gate closure in the NEM; participants are able to alter volumes (but not prices) in their offer up to tens of seconds before the delivery interval <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionBiddingGoodFaith2015 mcardleTwoRecentImprovements2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionBiddingGoodFaith2015" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-mcardleTwoRecentImprovements2021" role="doc-biblioref">McArdle, 2021a</a>)</span>. In 2021, the market settlement period was changed from 30 minutes (the average of prices of the preceding six 5-minute intervals) to 5 minutes to better align settlement with dispatch and pricing <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperator5MSCommencement2022">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperator5MSCommencement2022" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2022b</a>)</span>. Since resources are expected to linearly ramp between one dispatch target and the next, the dispatch process implicitly “procures” some flexibility to manage variability <span class="citation" data-cites="ryanVariableGenerationReserves2014 australianenergymarketoperatorDispatchStandardOperating2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorDispatchStandardOperating2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021d</a>; <a href="#ref-ryanVariableGenerationReserves2014" role="doc-biblioref">Ryan et al., 2014</a>)</span>. As such, the NEM’s dispatch is relatively fast and granular when compared to short-term electricity markets worldwide <span class="citation" data-cites="katzOpeningMarketsDesigning2019 silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022">(<a href="#ref-katzOpeningMarketsDesigning2019" role="doc-biblioref">Katz et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022" role="doc-biblioref">Silva-Rodriguez et al., 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The NEM’s real-time market is also able to elicit balancing flexibility provision from a variety of resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike some North American markets that permit large proportions of the generation fleet to self-schedule <span class="citation" data-cites="elaWholesaleElectricityMarket2016 orvisRefiningCompetitiveElectricity2018">(<a href="#ref-elaWholesaleElectricityMarket2016" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-orvisRefiningCompetitiveElectricity2018" role="doc-biblioref">Orvis and Aggarwal, 2018</a>)</span>, generation with a capacity above 30 MW is required to participate in the real-time market and receive dispatch instructions <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionNonscheduledGenerationLoad2017">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionNonscheduledGenerationLoad2017" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2017</a>)</span>. This exposes larger utility-scale resources, which make up the bulk of the NEM’s generation capacity, to price signals that somewhat reflect system balancing requirements.</li>
<li>VRE forecasts used in dispatch can be generated by AEMO or provided by market participants; due to very late gate closure, both are able to incorporate telemetered operational data from the minutes preceding delivery <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorSchedulingErrorReport2016 australianenergymarketoperatorSemiScheduledGenerationDispatch2018">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSemiScheduledGenerationDispatch2018" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2018f</a>, <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSchedulingErrorReport2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>In 2021, a wholesale demand response mechanism was implemented to enable larger loads (aggregated or otherwise) and virtual power plants (VPPs) to directly participate in the energy market<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorWholesaleDemandReponse2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorWholesaleDemandReponse2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020o</a>)</span>.</li>

<h4 data-number="7.4.1.2" id="forward-markets"><span class="header-section-number">7.4.1.2</span> Forward markets</h4>
<p>In the NEM, forward energy markets are voluntary and primarily consist of the trading of electricity derivatives between market participants. Though market participants can contract over-the-counter, the majority of forward market activity occurs on two market exchanges for standard products for periods up to 3 years out <span class="citation" data-cites="asxenergyAustralianElectricityMarket2021 australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2021">(<a href="#ref-asxenergyAustralianElectricityMarket2021" role="doc-biblioref">ASX Energy, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Regulator, 2021</a>)</span>. These standard products include quarterly or annual futures, which fix a price for an agreed quantity of energy, and caps, which are essentially call options that enable contract purchasers (typically electricity retailers) to pay no more than the strike price of 300 AUD/MWh for energy at the cost of a premium paid to the seller. Contract markets in SA are considered to be relatively illiquid compared to those in NSW, Queensland and Victoria <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2022">(<a href="#ref-australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2022" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Regulator, 2022a</a>)</span>. Beyond enabling market participants to hedge real-time market price risk, products traded on the forward markets may ‘discipline’ market participants into offering balancing flexibility to the system. For example, a generating market participant that sells futures and caps is likely to retain some reliable generation capacity in reserve to avoid large payouts in the event of high real-time prices or the failure of their other plants <span class="citation" data-cites="rieszAssessingViabilityEnergyonly2016">(<a href="#ref-rieszAssessingViabilityEnergyonly2016" role="doc-biblioref">Riesz et al., 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<h4 data-number="7.4.1.3" id="limitations"><span class="header-section-number">7.4.1.3</span> Limitations</h4>
<p>Despite the arguably world-leading flexible design of its real-time markets, there are some notable limitations in the NEM and its associated forward markets:</p>
<ul>
<li>To date, the balancing flexibility offered by DER has primarily been leveraged through unremunerated, last-resort curtailment of distributed solar PV in SA by AEMO <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorOperatingGridHigh2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorOperatingGridHigh2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021l</a>)</span> or through aggregated solar-battery VPPs. At the end of 2021, VPPs had a registered capacity of approximately 30 MW <span class="citation" data-cites="kuiperWhatStateVirtual2022">(<a href="#ref-kuiperWhatStateVirtual2022" role="doc-biblioref">Kuiper, 2022</a>)</span>, a small percentage of the ~15 GW of distributed solar PV capacity installed in the NEM as of June 2022 <span class="citation" data-cites="australianpvinstituteInstalledPVGeneration">(<a href="#ref-australianpvinstituteInstalledPVGeneration" role="doc-biblioref">Australian PV Institute, n.d.</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>Aside from the procurement of footroom that is only deployed following frequency excursions (Section 5.4.3), there are currently no mechanisms in the NEM that remunerate resources for providing sustained downwards flexibility to the system.</li>
<li>Standard derivative products have remained much the same for decades despite changes in the NEM’s resource mix and market dynamics. In particular, the 300 AUD/MWh strike price of cap contracts does not necessarily reflect a resource’s operating costs (e.g. the price of natural gas or the charging/pumping price for BESS/pumped hydro energy storage). While a demonstration project trialled a market platform for derivatives designed to be sold by flexible resources (e.g. a “Super Peak” contract that enables buyers to hedge morning and evening demand peaks), these are nascent products with small traded volumes to date <span class="citation" data-cites="renewableenergyhubRenewableEnergyHub2021">(<a href="#ref-renewableenergyhubRenewableEnergyHub2021" role="doc-biblioref">Renewable Energy Hub, 2021</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>AEMO has little visibility and no direct oversight over the voluntary forward markets, which are currently operated by the financial services sector. Moreover, even if AEMO did, it would likely be difficult for them to determine how portfolio-based contracting might influence the operation of particular resources <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionShortTermForward2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionShortTermForward2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2020d</a>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="7.4.2" id="sec:reserves-ahead_soint"><span class="header-section-number">7.4.2</span> Ahead processes and operator intervention</h3>
<p>Through several ahead processes, AEMO regularly publishes forecasted system and market information to assess power system reliability and assist market participant decision-making. The processes most relevant to operational decision-making include the near-term Projected Assessment of System Adequacy (PASA) and pre-dispatch simulations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using forecasts for demand and VRE, a simplified set of forecasted network constraints and participant-submitted resource availabilities and energy constraints, the Pre-Dispatch PASA and Short Term PASA (run every half-hour and hour, respectively) both assess the maximum generation reserves available in each region for the next 7 trading days. PASA outputs include half-hourly available generation and system load forecasts <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermPASA2012 australianenergymarketoperatorReliabilityStandardImplementation2020 australianenergymarketcommissionUpdatingShortTerm2022">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionUpdatingShortTerm2022" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorReliabilityStandardImplementation2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020p</a>, <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermPASA2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012a</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>Once day-ahead offers have been submitted by market participants, AEMO uses these offers in pre-dispatch processes alongside forecasts for constraints, demand and VRE. Pre-dispatch simulations then produce forecasts for dispatch conditions and regional prices for energy and FCAS. These are run every half hour at half-hourly resolution until the end of the next trading day (pre-dispatch) and at 5 minute resolution for the next hour (5 minute pre-dispatch) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorPreDispatch australianenergymarketoperatorPredispatchOperatingProcedure2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPreDispatch" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, n.d.</a>, <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPredispatchOperatingProcedure2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021k</a>)</span>. The potential impacts of demand forecast error on regional energy prices and interconnector flows are explored through a sensitivity analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorPreDispatchSensitivities2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPreDispatchSensitivities2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021m</a>)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regional balancing stress is indicated by the level of in-market reserves, which is the total offered generation capacity in excess of forecast regional demand<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>. Should the Short Term PASA or pre-dispatch processes forecast in-market reserves below specific trigger levels, AEMO must issue market notices that declare forecast Lack of Reserve (LOR) conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermReserve2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermReserve2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021n</a>)</span>. Trigger levels are set by the maximum of either deterministic generation contingencies (i.e. below N-2 for LOR1, below N-1 for LOR2 and no in-market reserves for LOR3), or a particular confidence level of a probability distribution of total forecasting errors generated by a Bayesian Belief Network, which is trained on historical forecast errors and power system conditions <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorReserveLevelDeclaration2018">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorReserveLevelDeclaration2018" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2018g</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The intention of these ahead process and LOR notices is to provide market participants with information that might elicit a response, such as shifting planned maintenance or rescheduling flexible resources in response to forecasted tight supply-demand balance conditions. However, if more severe LOR2 or LOR3 notices have been issued and AEMO deems that the market response is insufficient by a certain time, AEMO can intervene in the market by issuing directions (manual dispatch), activating emergency reserves procured through the Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT) and/or instructing transmission network operators to shed load <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermReserve2021 australianenergymarketoperatorReserveLevelDeclaration2018">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermReserve2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021n</a>, <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorReserveLevelDeclaration2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018g</a>)</span>.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.4.3" id="sec:reserves-nemreserves"><span class="header-section-number">7.4.3</span> Reserve products</h3>
<p>Formal reserves arrangements in the NEM consist of eight FCAS and the Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT). In each dispatch interval, FCAS are procured by AEMO from markets for raise (headroom) and lower (footroom) regulation FCAS, which are used to provide frequency control during normal operation, and three raise and lower contingency FCAS, which deliver their full response within 6 seconds, 60 seconds or 5 minutes following a major imbalance event. The volumes of FCAS procured for each dispatch interval are dynamically determined, with regulation FCAS procurement volumes dictated by power system time error and contingency FCAS procurement volumes typically corresponding to an N-1 contingency. In the absence of regional constraints, FCAS are procured for and from all regions of the NEM. While FCAS provides balancing flexibility through frequency-responsive headroom and footroom, they predominantly respond to intra-dispatch variability and uncertainty with the expectation that deployed resources will be relieved by 5-minute dispatch <span class="citation" data-cites="rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015 prakashInsightsDesigningEffective2022">(<a href="#ref-prakashInsightsDesigningEffective2022" role="doc-biblioref">Prakash et al., 2022a</a>; <a href="#ref-rieszFrequencyControlAncillary2015" role="doc-biblioref">Riesz et al., 2015</a>)</span>. 5 minute contingency FCAS is an exception, given that its response may be called upon for up to 10 minutes. 5 minute contingency FCAS is currently provided by a diverse range of resources (see Figure 15).</p>

</figure>
<p>Through the RERT, AEMO can obtain last-resort reserves given between 1 week to 1 year of notice of forecasted in-market reserves shortfalls. While procurement practices vary depending on the notice time, RERT procurement consists of AEMO contracting with out-of-market resources. Following forecast or actual LOR2 or LOR3 conditions and an insufficient market response, AEMO is able to activate RERT reserves <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionreliabilitypanelReliabilityEmergencyReserve2020 australianenergymarketoperatorProcedureExerciseReliability2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionreliabilitypanelReliabilityEmergencyReserve2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission Reliability Panel, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorProcedureExerciseReliability2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021o</a>)</span>. The RERT provides AEMO with a last-resort mechanism to procure balancing flexibility prior to any potential load shedding. However, resources that provide reserves through the RERT are unable to participate in the real-time market for the duration of their contract. After RERT reserves are activated, market participants are remunerated based on counterfactual pricing (i.e. dispatch without RERT), thus maintaining scarcity pricing and potential signals for investment.</p>
<h4 data-number="7.4.3.1" id="sec:reserves-orcontext"><span class="header-section-number">7.4.3.1</span> Operating reserves product</h4>
<p>An inter-dispatch operating reserve product has been proposed in the NEM. It would enable AEMO to procure headroom, which would need to be available to the real-time market within the product horizon, in each dispatch interval. Horizons of 5 minutes and 30 minutes were proposed <span class="citation" data-cites="energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021 australianenergymarketoperatorSubmissionAEMCDirections2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSubmissionAEMCDirections2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021p</a>; <a href="#ref-energysecurityboardPost2025Market2021" role="doc-biblioref">Energy Security Board, 2021a</a>)</span>. Market bodies and participants have raised several potential benefits of an operating reserve product:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It could address both inter-dispatch variability and uncertainty. Market bodies consider that the need to address the latter may be more material due to the growing impact of forecast uncertainty on system balancing and the potential for high impact, low probability power system events leading to extraordinary system imbalances <span class="citation" data-cites="egglestonSecurityResilienceTechnical2021 australianenergymarketcommissionReserveServicesNational2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionReserveServicesNational2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2021c</a>; <a href="#ref-egglestonSecurityResilienceTechnical2021" role="doc-biblioref">Eggleston et al., 2021</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>AEMO supports a 30+ minute horizon, as a longer timeframe product is likely to have a larger pool of providers and provide participants/AEMO with more lead time prior to any potential market intervention <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorSubmissionAEMCDirections2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSubmissionAEMCDirections2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021p</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>Through reserve constraints and potential scarcity pricing through an operating reserve demand curve <span class="citation" data-cites="hoganElectricityScarcityPricing2013">(<a href="#ref-hoganElectricityScarcityPricing2013" role="doc-biblioref">Hogan, 2013</a>)</span>, the product could act as an energy ‘price-adder’. This would enable real-time market prices for energy to better reflect consumers’ preference for reliability <span class="citation" data-cites="cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017">(<a href="#ref-cramtonElectricityMarketDesign2017" role="doc-biblioref">Cramton, 2017</a>)</span>.

A ‘price-adder’ could also provide sharper investment signals for flexible resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>The assessment of reserve capabilities to justify this new product has been limited. AEMO has previously analysed ramping capabilities over timeframes greater than 30 minutes <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020d</a>)</span>, the total reserve capacity available within various timeframes across NEM regions and years <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorSubmissionAEMCDirections2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSubmissionAEMCDirections2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021p</a>)</span> and regularly forecasts in-market reserves (Section 5.4.2). However, these studies do not consider flexibility capability available <em>after</em> resources are dispatched, or do not explore the time-varying spectrum of this capability. Using the methodology outlined in Section 5.5, we incorporate these elements when quantifying balancing flexibility capabilities in NSW and SA to inform an assessment of the operational benefits of additional balancing products (Section 5.6).</p>
<h2 data-number="7.5" id="sec:reserves-modeloverview"><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Modelling available reserves and footroom</h2>
<p>To quantify balancing flexibility capabilities, we consider headroom and footroom that can be converted to stable active power output within a particular time <em>horizon</em>. We will refer to these as <em>available reserves</em> and <em>available footroom</em><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>, respectively. Though these metrics do not explicitly consider whether resources are frequency-responsive, how long a potential response can be sustained for and whether network constraints restrain flexibility provision, calculating these quantities is broadly useful for understanding the balancing flexibility that could be deployed in a meshed system within operational timeframes (minutes to hours).</p>
<h3 data-number="7.5.1" id="quantifying-available-reserves-and-footroom"><span class="header-section-number">7.5.1</span> Quantifying available reserves and footroom</h3>
<p>At a given point in time and for a particular horizon, the available reserves and footroom that a resource can offer are dependent on its operational constraints, its synchronisation status and its active power output. The latter two can be obtained from historical data, or as the outputs of production-cost or market modelling.</p>
<p>Below, we outline a methodology for calculating system-wide available reserves and footroom (Section 5.5.1.5). We adapt the methodology proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="lannoyeEvaluationPowerSystem2012">Lannoye et al.

The nomenclature used in these sections is described in Section 5.5.1.1.</p>

<p>The quantities of reserves and footroom that can be made available by conventional resources are dependent on whether the resource is online (non-zero active power output) or offline.</p>
<p>A conventional resource unit is considered to be online if <span class="math inline">g_{r_c, t} &gt; 0</span>. The reserves that an online conventional resource unit can make available within the horizon <span class="math inline">h</span> (<span class="math inline">AR_{r_c,h,t}^{ON}</span>) is given by:</p>
<p><span id="eq:convonres"><span class="math display">AR_{r_c,h,t}^{ON} = \begin{cases}
          \mathrm{StartUp}_{r_c} \times h &amp; 0 &lt; g_{r_c,t} &lt; \mathrm{MSL}_{r_c}, h \leq \mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t} \\
          \min(\\ \hspace{0.2cm}(\mathrm{MSL}_{r_c} - g_{r_c,t}) + \mathrm{RampUp}_{r_c} \times (h - \mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t}),\\ \hspace{0.2cm}\overline{g}_{r_c,t} - g_{r_c,t}\\) &amp; 0 &lt; g_{r_c,t} &lt; \mathrm{MSL}_{r_c}, h &gt; \mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t} \\

      \end{cases}\qquad{(4)}</span></span></p>
<p>The three conditions in Equation 4 reflect the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The unit is in its start-up sequence (i.e. <span class="math inline">0&lt;g_{r_c,t}</span> &lt; <span class="math inline">\mathrm{MSL}_{r_c}</span>) and the reserve horizon (<span class="math inline">h</span>) is shorter than or equal to the unit’s start-up time (<span class="math inline">\mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t}</span>). In this case, the start-up ramp rate (<span class="math inline">\mathrm{StartUp}_{r_c}</span>) dictates the quantity of reserves that the unit can provide.</li>
<li>The unit is in its start-up sequence and the reserve horizon (<span class="math inline">h</span>) is longer than the unit’s start-up time (<span class="math inline">\mathrm{SUT}_{r_c,t}</span>). In this case, the quantity of reserves that the unit can provide is the minimum of the total unit ramping potential within the reserve horizon (at rate <span class="math inline">\mathrm{StartUp}_{r_c}</span> up to the unit’s minimum stable level, and <span class="math inline">\mathrm{RampUp}_{r_c}</span> beyond it) and the unit’s headroom.</li>
<li>The unit is operating above its minimum stable level. The quantity of reserves that the unit can provide is the minimum of the total unit ramping potential within the reserve horizon (at rate <span class="math inline">\mathrm{RampUp}_{r_c}</span>) and the unit’s headroom.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reserves that an offline conventional resource unit can make available within the horizon <span class="math inline">h</span> is given by Equation 5, which has two conditions that resemble the first two conditions of Equation 4:</p>

</div>
<p>Modelling SA and NSW across these three scenarios enables four sensitivities to be explored:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Conventional generation retirement</strong>. For NSW, one coal-fired power station is retired in 2025 Central and two in 2025 Step Change. In SA, four gas-powered steam turbine (Gas-Steam) units and two combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) units are retired between 2020 and both 2025 scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing deployment of VRE and BESS</strong>. Additional VRE and BESS capacity is deployed in both states between 2020 and 2025 Central in AEMO’s 2020 ISP. In the 2025 scenarios for both states, a greater quantity of VRE (predominantly solar PV) and BESS is installed in the Step Change scenario than in the Central scenario. The addition of 2 GW hydro generation in NSW by 2025 reflects the expansion of the region’s largest hydro scheme (Snowy 2.0). The capacity mix of each state in 2020 and the changes in the mix for each 2025 scenario are shown in Figure 16.</li>
<li><strong>Contrast in resource mix and thus operational constraints</strong>. In NSW in 2020, coal-fired generation is a large proportion of the generation fleet and is complemented by hydro generation, gas-fired generation (CCGTs and OCGTs) and VRE. In SA in 2020, VRE (especially wind) is a significant portion of the region’s generation fleet. SA’s synchronous generation consists of gas-fired generation across the flexibility spectrum, some of which must remain online to ensure there is sufficient system strength in SA for secure operation.</li>
<li><strong>Greater variability in operational demand due to more distributed solar PV</strong>. Operational demand is defined as the system demand that AEMO dispatches resources to meet (i.e. excluding demand met by DER). As the capacity of distributed solar PV in each region increases (i.e. from 2020 to 2025 Central to 2025 Step Change), operational demand in the middle of the day is eroded whilst ramping requirements in the morning (downwards) but especially the evening (upwards) increase. In other words, higher penetrations of distributed solar PV leads to a “deeper” duck curve <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020b">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorRenewableIntegrationStudy2020b" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020l</a>)</span>.</li>

<h3 data-number="7.6.2" id="sec:reserves-method"><span class="header-section-number">7.6.2</span> Methodology</h3>
<p>For each region and scenario, the available reserves and footroom in the system were calculated from the results of a year-long time-sequential market simulation implemented in the commercial electricity market modelling tool PLEXOS <span class="citation" data-cites="energyexemplarPLEXOSEnergyMarket2021">(<a href="#ref-energyexemplarPLEXOSEnergyMarket2021" role="doc-biblioref">Energy Exemplar, 2021</a>)</span>. The PLEXOS market simulation consisted of a PASA phase to model maintenance and forced outages for conventional generation across the year, a Medium Term Schedule phase in NSW to schedule hydro generation according to monthly energy constraints, and a Short Term Schedule phase that carries out unit commitment and economic dispatch (UC-ED) at 5-minute resolution in daily steps<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Each existing coal-fired (NSW) and Gas-Steam (SA) unit was explicitly modelled to accurately capture the consequences of partial and full outages of large capacity units. For other resource types, the operational constraints and attributes of individual units were averaged and applied across all units of a resource type. This enabled clustered UC-ED and thus reduced the computational burden of the Short Term Schedule phase <span class="citation" data-cites="palmintierHeterogeneousUnitClustering2014">(<a href="#ref-palmintierHeterogeneousUnitClustering2014" role="doc-biblioref">Palmintier and Webster, 2014</a>)</span>. For baseload conventional generation and gas turbines, ramp rates in each direction were separated into a <em>market</em> ramp rate, which was used in the PLEXOS market simulation, and an <em>upper</em> ramp rate, which was used to calculate available reserves/footroom (Section 5.5.1.2). A lower magnitude ramp rate in the market simulation (<em>market</em>) reflects participants’ preferences to reduce cycling wear-and-tear due to demanding ramping during typical operation (especially for ageing assets) <span class="citation" data-cites="kumarPowerPlantCycling2012">(<a href="#ref-kumarPowerPlantCycling2012" role="doc-biblioref">Kumar et al., 2012</a>)</span>, whilst using a higher magnitude ramp rate to calculate a resource’s available reserves and footroom (<em>upper</em>) ensures that the total available flexibility of a resource can be utilised if needed in a system emergency.</p>
<p>Both NSW and SA were modelled assuming a copper-plate network with no interconnection to other regions (i.e. single bus with no network constraints). The Short Term Schedule mixed-integer linear program was solved using the CPLEX Optimizer <span class="citation" data-cites="ibmCPLEXOptimizer2021">(<a href="#ref-ibmCPLEXOptimizer2021" role="doc-biblioref">IBM, 2021</a>)</span> with a relative mixed-integer program gap tolerance of 0.07%. The generation and synchronisation status of each resource was obtained from the solution and used to calculate the available reserves and footroom for each 5-minute interval using the equations outlined in Section 5.5. A process flow diagram of the study methodology is shown in Figure 17.</p>
<p>In Appendix A, we outline our sources for key input data and assumptions (top row of Figure 17) and provide further details regarding how these data were used in the market simulation and/or the calculation of available reserves and footroom.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.6.3" id="limitations-1"><span class="header-section-number">7.6.3</span> Limitations</h3>
<p>There are two important caveats to this study. The first is that this study models each region in isolation – that is, resources in other NEM regions can neither assist in meeting demand nor provide available reserves or footroom through cross-regional interconnectors. During typical operating conditions, it is likely that any headroom/footroom on interconnectors would mean that a greater quantity of reserves/footroom are available to a region, albeit at different horizons due to modified dispatch patterns. For example, the inclusion of interconnectors in the SA model between SA and VIC and SA and NSW<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> may increase the total available reserves/footroom in SA at the cost of a decrease in the reserves/footroom available within shorter horizons. This could arise from local mid-merit gas generators remaining offline in favour of inflexible but cheaper coal-fired generation in NSW and VIC.</p>
<p>However, modelling available reserves and footroom for isolated regions may provide a closer approximation to reality when balancing flexibility is scarce in a region. Under these circumstances, it is likely that interconnector flows will already be close to their limits. This will reduce or altogether prevent the available reserves/footroom provision from resources in neighbouring regions. Moreover, large interconnector flows may be prevented if there is a credible risk of regional separation (loss of synchronism between market regions due to interconnector circuit faults — a particular risk in the NEM due to limited interconnection between market regions); at present, AEMO co-optimises interconnector flow with regional FCAS procurement <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorConstraintFormulationGuidelines2010">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorConstraintFormulationGuidelines2010" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2010</a>)</span>. An additional consideration is that if an operating reserve product is implemented to improve the NEM’s resilience to supply-demand shocks, regional procurement requirements may also limit the available reserves/footroom that can be procured over an interconnector. As such, the modelling of isolated regions may approximate actual operation when reserves/footroom are scarce and thus most valuable to the system.</p>
<p>The second caveat is that this study does not explicitly model FCAS procurement. If headroom or footroom reserved for FCAS is unable to also provide available reserves or footroom<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>, then modelling FCAS markets would reduce the reserves and footroom that are available within horizons less than or equal to 5 minutes. However, the actual headroom/footroom reduction would depend upon the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether regional FCAS procurement constraints bind for the modelled region. If they do not, multi-regional or NEM-wide FCAS requirements can be satisfied by procuring FCAS in other market regions.</li>
<li>The degree to which headroom/footroom is “re-offered” across sequential FCAS markets. For example, a single resource enabled for 10 MW across the three raise contingency FCAS markets would withdraw less system headroom than three resources enabled for 10 MW each for a particular FCAS market.</li>
<li>Headroom that is offered into the 6 second and 60 second raise contingency FCAS market may not reflect sustained power provision. For example, frequency response from a steam-powered turbine may draw on steam stored in a boiler; a sustained response would require a longer timeframe due to slower boiler dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="7.6.4" id="sec:reserves-results"><span class="header-section-number">7.6.4</span> Results and discussion</h3>
<h4 data-number="7.6.4.1" id="synthetic-daily-profiles"><span class="header-section-number">7.6.4.1</span> Synthetic daily profiles</h4>
<p><em>Synthetic daily profiles</em> (SDPs) were developed to quantify the time-varying spectrum of available reserves and footroom for each scenario. For a given horizon, the SDP value at a particular time is an aggregate value (mean or a specific percentile) calculated from the reserves/footroom available within that horizon at the end of that dispatch interval across all days in the simulated year. In other words, values from across the year for a given time of day are aggregated, and these are then “stitched” together to form a “synthetic day” curve for a particular horizon. Two aggregate values were calculated for each horizon curve:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The mean. This provides a picture of the average or “typical” availability of reserves and footroom at different times of the day for a particular scenario year; and</li>
<li>The bottom 1% (i.e. 1<sup>st</sup> percentile or 1-in-100 day lowest). This measure better reflects the availability of reserves and footroom when they are scarce and thus when they are most needed<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to an infinite horizon (which corresponds to the maximum availability), curves were calculated for 1, 5, 15, 30 and 60 minute horizons. These horizons encompass the start-up times of hydro and flexible gas generation, and represent the likely timeframes over which the proposed operating reserve product will be required to respond.</p>
<h4 data-number="7.6.4.2" id="sec:reserves-reserveSDPs"><span class="header-section-number">7.6.4.2</span> Available reserve synthetic days</h4>
<p>Mean and bottom 1% available reserve SDPs were generated for the NSW scenarios and for the SA scenarios (Figures 18, 19). The mean SDPs across scenarios suggest that, on average, NSW has more than 2 GW and SA more than 600 MW of reserves available within 5+ minutes. These levels of reserves:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Correspond to approximately 15% and 20% of peak demand in 2020 in NSW and SA, respectively. These 5+ minute “reserve margins” (i.e. 5+ minute reserves as a percentage of peak demand) are comparable to lower-end reserve margins anticipated for the summer of 2022 in North American jurisdictions <span class="citation" data-cites="northamericanelectricreliabilitycorporation2022SummerReliability2022">(<a href="#ref-northamericanelectricreliabilitycorporation2022SummerReliability2022" role="doc-biblioref">North American Electric Reliability Corporation, 2022</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>Exceed the highest N-1 contingency in 2020 (i.e. highest LOR2 trigger level declared in the last run of Pre-Dispatch PASA prior to delivery — see Section 5.4.2) by approximately 225% in NSW and 170% in SA <span class="citation" data-cites="prakashNEMSEERPythonPackage2023">(<a href="#ref-prakashNEMSEERPythonPackage2023" role="doc-biblioref">Prakash et al., 2023b</a>)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, with additional BESS and flexible gas resources expected to be deployed, the mean 5+ minute reserve margins of both regions are higher for most parts of the day in the 2025 Step Change scenario. Though the market simulation relied on perfect foresight (additional uncertainty may reduce reserve margins), these results suggest that reasonable quantities of reserves are available in each region within a 5+ minute horizon.</p>

</figure>
<p>Across scenarios, the following trends are apparent in the SDPs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From 2020 to the 2025 Step Change scenario, a midday peak in the mean available reserves SDPs becomes more pronounced. This can be attributed to the increasing displacement of conventional generation by lower-cost utility-scale solar PV in dispatch (an outcome observed by <span class="citation" data-cites="hummonFundamentalDriversCost2013">Hummon et al. (<a href="#ref-hummonFundamentalDriversCost2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="tanotoImpactHighSolar2021">Tanoto et al. (<a href="#ref-tanotoImpactHighSolar2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>) and the progressive erosion of daytime operational demand due to higher penetrations of distributed solar PV. Particularly in SA, curtailed VRE and BESS also contribute to this reserve “surplus”. BESS in particular are often charging during such periods of plentiful supply and low prices, and thus are able to offer up to double their active power rating as reserve (i.e. by switching from charging to discharging).</li>
<li>As is particularly clear in the bottom 1% SDPs for the 2025 scenarios, the availabilities of different reserve horizons tend to converge during periods of lower reserves or “relative scarcity”, which include peak demand events in the morning and evening. The convergence may be driven by the retirement of baseload conventional generation and higher ramping requirements in the 2025 scenarios requiring more flexible, mid-merit resources to be online prior to and during these periods.</li>
</ol>
<p>From this analysis, we can also gain an insight into the supply-side dynamics of a potential operating reserve product market. The first trend suggests that as energy transition proceeds, a reserve surplus during the daytime could suppress the price of an operating reserve product (a dynamic that is further explored by <span class="citation" data-cites="frewCurtailmentParadoxTransition2021">Frew et al. (<a href="#ref-frewCurtailmentParadoxTransition2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021b</a>)</span>). Moreover, the convergence of availability across horizons during periods of “relative scarcity” suggests that relatively inflexible but cheaper resources are being preferentially ramped through dispatch at these times whilst more flexible but expensive resources are left in reserve. Since the majority of system headroom during these periods appears to be available within 5 to 15 minutes, operating reserves would likely be procured from these more flexible resources regardless of whether the product requires availability within 5 or 30 minutes. As such, concerns regarding limited providers of a 5-minute horizon product may also apply to a 30-minute horizon product during periods of relative scarcity (noting that several resource types in the NEM are already providing upwards flexibility within 5 minutes in the NEM, as shown in Figure 15).</p>
<h4 data-number="7.6.4.3" id="sec:reserves-footroomSDPs"><span class="header-section-number">7.6.4.3</span> Available footroom synthetic days</h4>
<p>Two types of SDPs were constructed for available footroom: one for <em>firm</em> footroom and the other for total footroom. The former refers to potential footroom provision from conventional resources and BESS, whereas the latter also includes footroom that can be provided by curtailing VRE. Figures 20, 21 show mean and bottom 1% SDPs across NSW scenarios for firm footroom and total footroom, respectively. From the bottom 1% SDPs in Figure 20, it is clear that firm system footroom can become very low in NSW in 2025 as remaining baseload conventional generators are driven to operate closer to their MSLs. However, such concerns could be alleviated if VRE provide footroom (Figure 21). A similar result was observed for the SA region.</p>

<p>The available footroom in the system is likely sensitive to extent of conventional generation retirements. Further retirements may enable remaining conventional resources to operate at a higher loading, thereby increasing the available footroom in the system. Regardless, given that each region appears to suffer a lack of <em>firm</em> footroom for several hours during the day in the 2025 scenarios explored in this case study, mechanisms for procuring sustained downwards balancing flexibility should be considered alongside those for procuring sustained upwards balancing flexibility. One simple option would be to implement an operating <em>footroom</em> product, which, if VRE are permitted to provide this service, can enable conventional generation to operate closer to their MSL and thus reduce system operating costs and carbon emissions <span class="citation" data-cites="nelsonInvestigatingEconomicValue2018">(<a href="#ref-nelsonInvestigatingEconomicValue2018" role="doc-biblioref">Nelson et al., 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<h4 data-number="7.6.4.4" id="sec:reserves-stelr"><span class="header-section-number">7.6.4.4</span> Short-term energy-limited reserves</h4>
<p>While the available reserves metric does not consider the duration for which reserve deployment can be sustained, we can infer whether reserves are short-term energy-limited (i.e. with a duration no more than a few hours) based on their resource type. For this analysis, BESS reserve power was calculated based on the BESS’s state of charge at the end of each dispatch interval and the requirement to sustain provision for 15 minutes. This duration is consistent with the BESS power and capacity that is reserved in SA for the possibility of loss of interconnection <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperator2020SystemStrength2020">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020SystemStrength2020" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2020q</a>)</span>. In addition, the maximum available price-responsive demand available in each state was added to the available reserves in each dispatch interval (assuming an emergency response time of 5 minutes) to gain a better understanding of the maximum potential contribution of demand response. This corresponded to ~60 MW in SA and ~290 MW in NSW, based on AEMO analysis and forecasts in <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020">Australian Energy Market Operator (<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020b</a>)</span>. Both BESS and DR can be considered to be short-term energy-limited reserve providers. Though conventional generation fuel constraints (e.g reservoir schemes and the gas system) were not modelled in this market simulation, the contribution of conventional resources was separated into those of thermal and hydro to assess the importance of the energy constraints on each resource type to available reserves in NSW.</p>
<p>Tables and show the median percentage across dispatch intervals in a scenario year of available reserves provided by a resources type for NSW and SA, respectively. Whilst hydro and thermal resources dominate 5 minute horizon reserve provision in 2020 in NSW and SA, respectively, short-term energy limited resources provide a greater proportion of reserves in this horizon in 2025. In particular, the median contribution of BESS to reserves available within 5 minutes is 16% for NSW and 40% for SA in the 2025 Step Change scenario. As the reserve horizon is extended to 30 minutes, a greater proportion of reserves are provided by conventional resources, which may be better positioned to sustain a response beyond the short-term<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>. These results indicate that as energy transition progresses, a trade-off between reserve deployment speed and duration develops. This trend reaffirms the value of the sequential and hierarchical approach to reserve product design and deployment that has been adopted in many jurisdictions <span class="citation" data-cites="prakashInsightsDesigningEffective2022">(<a href="#ref-prakashInsightsDesigningEffective2022" role="doc-biblioref">Prakash et al., 2022a</a>)</span>. Moreover, it should be noted that unlike other mechanisms for procuring balancing flexibility, reserve services and products can specify duration/energy requirements and thus ensure that flexibility provision is sustained.</p>
<h3 data-number="7.6.5" id="the-role-of-balancing-products"><span class="header-section-number">7.6.5</span> The role of balancing products</h3>
<p>It is unclear whether introducing an operating reserve product will deliver material operational benefits to the NEM in light of the revenue risks, complexity, and implementation and ongoing costs associated with a new market. Instead, existing mechanisms may be able to deliver sufficient upwards flexibility, particularly if they can be augmented:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Market participants with forward market obligations are strongly incentivised to offer balancing flexibility to the market. The premium payment offered to the seller, along with a strong financial incentive to perform during periods of system stress, means that derivatives such as cap contracts somewhat resemble pay-for-performance capacity remuneration mechanisms<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>. Participants would have further incentive if contracting were made mandatory <span class="citation" data-cites="maysPrivateRiskSocial2022">(<a href="#ref-maysPrivateRiskSocial2022" role="doc-biblioref">Mays et al., 2022</a>)</span>, or if they increasingly resort to contracting to hedge pricing volatility that could occur as energy transition progresses <span class="citation" data-cites="devriesMarketSignalsAdequacy2022">(<a href="#ref-devriesMarketSignalsAdequacy2022" role="doc-biblioref">de Vries and Sanchez Jimenez, 2022</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Market and system information and forecasts (e.g. the NEM’s ahead processes) may be critical to ensuring that market participants schedule resources to provide flexibility to the system. Future work should not only seek to improve their accuracy and their treatment of uncertainties, but also to understand how they shape participant decision-making and thus which enhancements could provide the most value.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>However, there remain some operational benefits of additional balancing products. Nested distribution-level markets and/or real-time market scheduling of aggregated resources have the potential to better enable balancing flexibility from DER. However, a key insight from Section 5.6.4.4 is that consideration should be given to the duration of this flexibility. System stress could coincide with periods in which DER owners wish to use these resources for themselves (e.g. a heatwave or if they are exposed to real-time market volatility to some extent) <span class="citation" data-cites="robertsVPPUserResearch2020">(<a href="#ref-robertsVPPUserResearch2020" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts et al., 2020</a>)</span>. In contrast, reserve products that specify response durations could provide the SO with certainty that flexibility is only procured from resources that are available for a minimum period of time. Any duration requirements would need to be balanced against the quantity and diversity of flexibility providers – primarily to ensure that product markets are competitive, but also because successive deployment of several short-term energy limited resources may be sufficient to meet system balancing needs over the course of a few hours. Furthermore, sustained footroom products might assist SOs in managing a lack of firm footroom (Section 5.6.4.3). Typically, energy prices rise when upwards flexibility is scarce, thereby compensating providers of upward flexibility. In contrast, downwards flexibility providers are not strictly compensated through energy pricing, as oversupply could lead to dispatch curtailing, rather than remunerating flexible resources. Though this might mean flexible resources avoid financial losses, it comes at the cost of footroom available to the system. Accordingly, an “operating footroom” product that remunerates downwards flexibility offers a solution to the tension between dispatch incentives and the need for system footroom.</p>
<h2 data-number="7.7" id="sec:reserves-conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">7.7</span> Conclusion and policy implications</h2>
<p>State-of-the-art resource adequacy assessments are closing the gap between traditional capacity adequacy assessments, which focus on capacity reserve margins during peak demand events, and flexibility adequacy assessments that often model chronological operations <span class="citation" data-cites="stenclikQuantifyingRiskUncertain2021">(<a href="#ref-stenclikQuantifyingRiskUncertain2021" role="doc-biblioref">Stenclik et al., 2021</a>)</span>. Yet flexibility adequacy assessments alone do not necessarily offer a better understanding of <em>what type</em> of balancing flexibility a system has and might need, and <em>how</em> best to make it available to the system. As resource mixes change dramatically during energy transition, system designers, planners and operators should quantify balancing flexibility capabilities to gain an appreciation of the availability of different resource types to inform operational practice design.</p>
<p>By quantifying balancing flexibility “margins” in two sub-systems of the Australian National Electricity Market (Section 5.6), we identify potential balancing flexibility dynamics and trends in future power systems. Firstly, systems with high penetrations of distributed and utility-scale solar PV will likely have reserve “surpluses” around the middle of the day and periods of relative reserve scarcity during morning and evening peak demand events. In such systems, the periods when reserves are most valuable do not necessarily correspond to the periods during which it is most efficient to curtail renewable energy generation (due to oversupply or to obtain reserves). As such, a key recommendation for policy-makers is to consider whether reserve product markets are needed to elicit sufficient balancing flexibility provision during these short periods of relative scarcity, or whether adjusting energy market settings, forward market obligations and/or market and system information processes can achieve this. Understanding the potential benefits of new reserve product markets is crucial because they can introduce additional costs, constraints and complexity whilst encroaching upon the functions of other operational practices. Secondly, our study highlights the importance of placing a greater emphasis on duration, as resources touted as essential future balancing flexibility providers (e.g. battery energy storage, demand response) may only be able to sustain a response for at most a few hours. Thirdly, we highlight the need to consider footroom and the benefits of enabling renewable energy to provide it. Footroom procurement and response duration specifications are underappreciated by prevailing market designs, and may be better addressed by policy-makers either modifying existing or creating new reserve product specifications.</p>

<h2 data-number="8.2" id="abstract-3"><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Abstract</h2>
<p>In wholesale electricity markets, resource schedules result from market participant decisions informed by knowledge processes, which provide current and forecasted power system and market information. Ensuring that these knowledge processes and market participation rules are purpose-fit is becoming increasingly important with growing deployments of energy storage resources expected to aid in balancing high renewables power systems through energy arbitrage.</p>
<p>Our study explores the scheduling coordination role of centralised price forecasts generated by the system and market operator in the fast, flexible and volatile Australian National Electricity Market. Our work offers three contributions: (1) highlighting the increasing frequency and severity of errors in these forecasts, and proposing a hypothesis that market participant (re)bidding is partially responsible for this phenomenon; (2) modelling the extent to which arbitrage revenues might be reduced should these forecasts guide battery energy storage scheduling; and (3) discussing potential changes to participant scheduling strategies and market design that could improve scheduling outcomes. We recommend that Australian policy-makers not only increase the frequency at which centralised knowledge processes are run, but also consider whether stricter market participation restrictions might incentivise participant bidding strategies that are less likely to induce sudden price forecast swings that can hamper effective scheduling.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.3" id="sec:info-intro"><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Effectively and efficiently scheduling electrical power system resources (generators, loads, energy storage and network elements) is crucial to achieving the primary goal of power system operators (SOs): least-cost active power balancing subject to technical constraints. Resource scheduling procedures have changed not only with shifts in resource mixes <span class="citation" data-cites="elaWholesaleElectricityMarket2016 orvisRefiningCompetitiveElectricity2018">(<a href="#ref-elaWholesaleElectricityMarket2016" role="doc-biblioref">Ela et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-orvisRefiningCompetitiveElectricity2018" role="doc-biblioref">Orvis and Aggarwal, 2018</a>)</span> and advances in information technology and algorithm design <span class="citation" data-cites="isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009 knuevenMixedintegerProgrammingFormulations2020">(<a href="#ref-isemongerEvolvingDesignRTO2009" role="doc-biblioref">Isemonger, 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-knuevenMixedintegerProgrammingFormulations2020" role="doc-biblioref">Knueven et al., 2020</a>)</span>, but also where jurisdictions have restructured their electricity industries to replace vertically-integrated utilities with competitive wholesale electricity markets <span class="citation" data-cites="chowElectricityMarketDesign2005">(<a href="#ref-chowElectricityMarketDesign2005" role="doc-biblioref">Chow et al., 2005</a>)</span>. Such restructuring has produced three shifts in the scheduling process <span class="citation" data-cites="chaoInterfaceEngineeringMarket2005 sioshansiElectricityMarketReform2006 woodPowerGenerationOperation2014">(<a href="#ref-chaoInterfaceEngineeringMarket2005" role="doc-biblioref">Chao et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#ref-sioshansiElectricityMarketReform2006" role="doc-biblioref">Sioshansi, 2006</a>; <a href="#ref-woodPowerGenerationOperation2014" role="doc-biblioref">Wood et al., 2014</a>)</span>. Firstly, resource information became more distributed since only market participants (MPs) know their resources’ <em>true</em> status, operational constraints and cost structures. Thus SOs, which are typically no longer vertically-integrated, may have limited visibility of system resources. Secondly, decision-making has become more decentralised, with MPs <em>choosing</em> how they participate by submitting offers, bids and technical constraints that may or may not be truthful<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>. Thirdly, and most pertinent to this work, resource scheduling decisions are no longer solely made by the SO based on system conditions; instead, MPs’ scheduling decisions are primarily motivated by <em>prices</em> for energy and other system services.</p>
<p>Several economists (notably F. A. Hayek) have argued that the price system is a preferable coordinating mechanism for production and planning where “dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge” are possessed by diverse actors <span class="citation" data-cites="hayekUseKnowledgeSociety1945 littlechildHayekTexasBlackout2021">(<a href="#ref-hayekUseKnowledgeSociety1945" role="doc-biblioref">Hayek, 1945, p. 519</a>; <a href="#ref-littlechildHayekTexasBlackout2021" role="doc-biblioref">Littlechild and Kiesling, 2021</a>)</span>. While we do not assess the merit of this argument in this article, we adopt its underlying logic: that markets are “mechanisms for collecting, processing and disseminating relevant information” <span class="citation" data-cites="vonderfehrTransparencyElectricityMarkets2013">(<a href="#ref-vonderfehrTransparencyElectricityMarkets2013" role="doc-biblioref">Von Der Fehr, 2013, p. 93</a>)</span>. In the context of electricity markets, this can be understood through two almost inseparable activities that together lead to the collation and transmission of information through prices. Firstly, a MP submits a set of offers/bids that reflects their knowledge, operational objectives, and technical and commercial positions. Secondly, the information in offers/bids is then integrated into projected or binding prices. These two activities occur iteratively in price formation, a dynamic process in which MPs continuously adjust their participation in response to new information <span class="citation" data-cites="bowlesRetrospectivesFriedrichHayek2017">(<a href="#ref-bowlesRetrospectivesFriedrichHayek2017" role="doc-biblioref">Bowles et al., 2017</a>)</span>. Achieving an equilibrium (optimal or otherwise) is not guaranteed; it is a special outcome that arises only from convergence in price formation <span class="citation" data-cites="creativeenergyconsultingptyltdSchedulingAheadMarkets2020">(<a href="#ref-creativeenergyconsultingptyltdSchedulingAheadMarkets2020" role="doc-biblioref">Creative Energy Consulting Pty Ltd, 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>From this perspective, resource schedules are the outcome of an information aggregation and exchange process mediated by binding and forecasted prices in the electricity market. Assuming that prices reflect the system’s condition and needs<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>, then appropriate and frequently-run knowledge processes are a prerequisite of the iterative participation that is necessary (but not sufficient) for convergence towards a set of resources schedules that deliver good social welfare outcomes. These knowledge processes can be privately-run (i.e. by MPs or their information consultants) or centralised for the purpose of disseminating consistent public information (e.g. those run by a public meteorological service or the SO) <span class="citation" data-cites="schweppeSpotPricingElectricity1988 vonderfehrTransparencyElectricityMarkets2013 maysPrivateRiskSocial2022">(<a href="#ref-maysPrivateRiskSocial2022" role="doc-biblioref">Mays et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-schweppeSpotPricingElectricity1988" role="doc-biblioref">Schweppe et al., 1988</a>; <a href="#ref-vonderfehrTransparencyElectricityMarkets2013" role="doc-biblioref">Von Der Fehr, 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Though frictions in knowledge and market participation processes are problematic for optimising the schedules of all power system resources, they are arguably more so for energy storage resources (ESRs) with diurnal storage durations (i.e. &lt; 12 hours). These include most battery energy storage systems (BESS) and some pumped hydro storage schemes <span class="citation" data-cites="frazierStorageFuturesStudy2021">(<a href="#ref-frazierStorageFuturesStudy2021" role="doc-biblioref">Frazier et al., 2021</a>)</span>.

Furthermore, to maximise revenues from standalone storage operation, MPs must schedule charging, which replenishes the stored energy necessary to provide more lucrative raise/upwards market products and services, during periods of low (or negative) energy prices<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In this article, we explore the implications of using “forecasts”<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> generated by centralised knowledge processes to schedule ESRs with diurnal storage durations in the fast, flexible and volatile Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Developments in the NEM will be of broad interest given its high penetration of variable renewable energy (VRE) (demonstrated by a record maximum instantaneous renewable energy penetration of ~73% in Q4 2023) <span class="citation" data-cites="globalpowerenergyWelcomeGPENEMLog22023">(<a href="#ref-globalpowerenergyWelcomeGPENEMLog22023" role="doc-biblioref">Global Power Energy, 2023</a>)</span>, a considerable and growing number of ESRs, and because its real-time market design has long included several features – namely short market intervals, market gate closure close to delivery and a high price cap – that policy-makers elsewhere have considered or implemented in response to the proliferation of VRE in their jurisdictions <span class="citation" data-cites="internationalrenewableenergyagencyAdaptingMarketDesign2017 katzOpeningMarketsDesigning2019 papavasiliouScarcityPricingMissing2020 silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022">(<a href="#ref-internationalrenewableenergyagencyAdaptingMarketDesign2017" role="doc-biblioref">International Renewable Energy Agency, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-katzOpeningMarketsDesigning2019" role="doc-biblioref">Katz et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-papavasiliouScarcityPricingMissing2020" role="doc-biblioref">Papavasiliou, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022" role="doc-biblioref">Silva-Rodriguez et al., 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Our work offers three contributions to the literature on ESR scheduling under imperfect foresight and future electricity market design. Firstly, we analyse historical centralised price forecast data from the NEM to show that the frequency of divergence in these forecasts has increased in recent years, and that supply-driven extreme price forecast swings can occur suddenly. We subsequently examine MP (re)bidding data and suggest that these phenomena could be partially explained by both the greater number of flexible resources with automated bidding capabilities and a NEM MP’s ability to continuously rebid up until a few seconds before delivery. Secondly, we use the same price forecast data from a recent year to assess the impact of divergences and price swings on battery energy storage system (BESS) wholesale energy market arbitrage revenue – a metric that arguably reflects the ESR’s contribution to system balancing. In particular, our assessment tests the sensitivity of arbitrage revenues to parameters such as the BESS’ storage duration (ranging from 15 minutes to 8 hours), the length of the forecast lookahead (i.e. how far the scheduler looks into the future) and different objective functions (i.e. how the scheduler interprets arbitrage opportunities). Our results show that using these price forecasts to schedule BESSs can significantly reduce arbitrage revenue from what would be achievable with perfect foresight. Thirdly, we discuss MP scheduling options and potential changes to centralised knowledge processes and market design that could improve resource scheduling outcomes in the NEM and other electricity markets with increasing penetrations of VRE and storage.</p>
<p>Section 6.4 provides an overview of market information, participation and clearing processes in the NEM in addition to context on grid-scale ESR deployment, operation and market participation to date. In Section 6.5, we present a two-part case study of the NEM. We first examine errors in SO-produced operational price forecasts and propose a hypothesis to explain increasing divergence and the occurrence of price swings in Section 6.5.1. Then, in Section 6.5.2, we use the same centralised price forecasts to schedule a variety of BESSs for arbitrage in one NEM region to assess the impact of price forecast errors (and more broadly, imperfect foresight) on arbitrage revenue. Based on our findings from Section 6.5, we discuss the advantages, disadvantages and feasibility of changes to MP scheduling, centralised knowledge processes and market design that could maximise the balancing value of resources in Section 6.6. We conclude by highlighting pertinent findings and recommendations to policy-makers in Section 6.7.</p>

<p>The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which is both the system and market operator, clears a gross pool energy market and 10 voluntary frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) markets<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> every 5 minutes through a co-optimised and security-constrained economic dispatch process. For each dispatch interval, this process produces resource dispatch targets (i.e. power output levels and for FCAS providers, headroom/footroom obligations), and zonal energy and FCAS prices for market regions that correspond to the country’s five most densely populated states: Queensland (QLD), New South Wales (NSW), Victoria (VIC), Tasmania (TAS) and South Australia (SA). Market prices can be between the NEM’s market floor (-1,000 AUD/MW/hr) and its market cap (15,100 AUD/MW/hr in the Australian financial year 2021-22), which is one of the highest in the world <span class="citation" data-cites="silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022">(<a href="#ref-silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022" role="doc-biblioref">Silva-Rodriguez et al., 2022</a>)</span>.

Specifically, though its mandatory gross pool auctions produce resource dispatch obligations, MPs are given free rein to self manage resource commitment and market participation decisions through a bidding process based not on (verifiable) costs, but prices <span class="citation" data-cites="conejoRethinkingRestructuredElectricity2018 katonaPriceMechanismSurvey2023">(<a href="#ref-conejoRethinkingRestructuredElectricity2018" role="doc-biblioref">Conejo and Sioshansi, 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-katonaPriceMechanismSurvey2023" role="doc-biblioref">Katona et al., 2023</a>)</span>. As a minimum requirement, MPs must submit resource-specific bids and offers by 12:30 PM Australian Eastern Standard Time on the day ahead of delivery for one or more of the NEM’s real-time markets <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorSpotMarketOperations2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorSpotMarketOperations2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021q</a>)</span>. Bids and offers are sealed (i.e. not publicly available until the day after delivery) and consist of up to 10 price-quantity bands, with MPs submitting a single set of price bands for the entirety of the next trading day and a set of quantities for each dispatch interval in the next trading day<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>.

<p>Whilst MPs cannot change band prices after the day-ahead deadline, they can modify the quantities they offer in each band via a “rebid”. Market rules dictate that MPs must “as soon as practicable” submit rebids that are not “false or misleading” with a “brief, verifiable and specific reason for the rebid” <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergyregulatorRebiddingTechnicalParameters2019 australianenergymarketcommissionNationalElectricityRules2023">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionNationalElectricityRules2023" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2023a</a>; <a href="#ref-australianenergyregulatorRebiddingTechnicalParameters2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Regulator, 2019b</a>)</span>.

<h4 data-number="8.4.1.2" id="sec:info-context-nem-knowledge_processes"><span class="header-section-number">8.4.1.2</span> Market knowledge processes</h4>
<p>Given that the NEM’s real-time auctions are blind and because it lacks short-term ahead markets that impose physical and/or financial obligations on MPs, AEMO is responsible for running ahead-of-delivery knowledge processes that assess system reliability and generate information to assist MP with making market participation decisions. These knowledge processes include the Projected Assessment of System Adequacy (PASA) and pre-dispatch processes. With inputs including forecasted network constraints and participant-submitted resource availabilities and energy constraints, resource adequacy information is produced for the next two years by Medium Term PASA’s production cost models, which use demand and VRE traces from several reference weather years, and for the next week by Pre-Dispatch PASA and Short Term PASA, which use demand and VRE forecasts in a simple system reliability model <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorMediumTermPASA2021 australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermPASA2012">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorMediumTermPASA2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021r</a>, <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermPASA2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012a</a>)</span>. The half-hourly demand, VRE, available generation and reserve forecasts published by the shorter-term PASA processes are particularly useful for MPs scheduling resources. Pre-dispatch processes, on the other hand, use the latest set of MP offers alongside system forecasts in a modified version of the NEM’s dispatch algorithm to generate regional energy and FCAS price forecasts and sensitivities that predict the impact of demand forecast errors on prices and power flows between market regions<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorPreDispatchSensitivities2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPreDispatchSensitivities2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021m</a>)</span>. These are published at half-hourly resolution until the end of the next trading day (30MPD) and at five minute resolution for the next hour (5MPD) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorPredispatchOperatingProcedure2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPredispatchOperatingProcedure2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021k</a>)</span>. Both PASA and pre-dispatch processes perform a reliability function in addition to providing MPs with market information; if forecast reserves fall below certain trigger levels and AEMO deems the market response to be insufficient by a certain time, it can take emergency actions to ensure the system remains balanced <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermReserve2021 australianenergymarketoperatorReserveLevelDeclaration2018">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorShortTermReserve2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021n</a>, <a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorReserveLevelDeclaration2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018g</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>AEMO refers to the prices generated by pre-dispatch processes as “forecasts”, but they cannot strictly be considered as such since one of their purposes is to provide a <em>signal</em> that elicits market responses from MPs <span class="citation" data-cites="huEmpiricalObservationsBidding2005">(<a href="#ref-huEmpiricalObservationsBidding2005" role="doc-biblioref">Hu et al., 2005</a>)</span>. For example, a high initial pre-dispatch price might motivate a MP to commit or reschedule their resources through inframarginal rebids, but doing so could then depress the price in the next pre-dispatch run. This may, in turn, drive the same or other MPs to adjust their participation preferences (and so on). As such, the NEM’s iterative pre-dispatch processes in theory provide a platform for coordinating privately-owned resources in the production of a system schedule <span class="citation" data-cites="creativeenergyconsultingptyltdSchedulingAheadMarkets2020">(<a href="#ref-creativeenergyconsultingptyltdSchedulingAheadMarkets2020" role="doc-biblioref">Creative Energy Consulting Pty Ltd, 2020</a>)</span>. However, in practice, prices may not necessarily converge as real-time approaches, leading to less efficient market participation decisions and less effective scheduling outcomes. As demand and VRE forecasts generally improve closer to real-time, any divergence in pre-dispatch forecasts run close to the delivery interval is likely to be a result of MP rebidding, sudden outages and/or differences between the constraints in pre-dispatch and actual dispatch <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorPredispatchOperatingProcedure2021">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorPredispatchOperatingProcedure2021" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021k</a>)</span>.</p>

<h4 data-number="8.4.2.1" id="sec:info-context-esr-operation"><span class="header-section-number">8.4.2.1</span> Factors influencing scheduling</h4>
<p>Previous work has explored three factors that have a strong bearing on how ESRs are self-scheduled<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> and thus the degree of assistance they provide in balancing the system.</p>

<p>ESRs are technically capable of providing a range of services that grows wider as the point of installation approaches energy consumers <span class="citation" data-cites="fitzgeraldEconomicsBatteryEnergy2015">(<a href="#ref-fitzgeraldEconomicsBatteryEnergy2015" role="doc-biblioref">Fitzgerald et al., 2015</a>)</span>. Though it is often assumed that operators can “value stack” these services (i.e. provide them simultaneously), constraints of a technical, organisational and/or regulatory nature mean that ESR scheduling often involves trade-offs between the services it can provide and thus the objectives it can fulfil <span class="citation" data-cites="keckDriversBenefitsShared2021 ransan-cooperApplyingResponsibleAlgorithm2021">(<a href="#ref-keckDriversBenefitsShared2021" role="doc-biblioref">Keck and Lenzen, 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-ransan-cooperApplyingResponsibleAlgorithm2021" role="doc-biblioref">Ransan-Cooper et al., 2021</a>)</span>. Moreover, an ESR’s operational objectives are likely to be dictated by the objectives of the storage operator’s broader portfolio. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="wangOptimalSchedulingEnergy2017">Wang et al. (<a href="#ref-wangOptimalSchedulingEnergy2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> demonstrate that an ESR can be scheduled to minimise a load-serving entity’s day-ahead deviation liabilities, <span class="citation" data-cites="loiselMarketStrategiesLargescale2021">Loisel and Simon (<a href="#ref-loiselMarketStrategiesLargescale2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> show how pumped hydro storage is used to support nuclear resources within the portfolio of France’s largest electricity producer, and <span class="citation" data-cites="billimoriaContractDesignStorage2023a">Billimoria and Simshauser (<a href="#ref-billimoriaContractDesignStorage2023a" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> explore the impact of storage contracts and their design on the alignment between financial incentives for MPs and system needs in operational timeframes.

<h5 data-number="8.4.2.1.2" id="storage-operator-preferences-and-attitudes"><span class="header-section-number">8.4.2.1.2</span> Storage operator preferences and attitudes</h5>
<p>Beyond the choice of which services the ESR should provide, the preferences and attitudes that affect ESR operation include the storage operator’s risk appetite and their ability (as well as their willingness) to take or make market prices. <span class="citation" data-cites="shafieeEconomicAssessmentPricemaker2016">Shafiee et al. (<a href="#ref-shafieeEconomicAssessmentPricemaker2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> show that accounting for an ESR’s price-making potential in its scheduling algorithm may lead to the resource curtailing its discharge during high energy prices to avoid “cannibalising” its own revenues. Similarly, <span class="citation" data-cites="yurdakulRiskAverseSelfSchedulingStorage2023">Ogun Yurdakul and Billimoria (<a href="#ref-yurdakulRiskAverseSelfSchedulingStorage2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>, using a stochastic risk-based scheduling algorithm to model the decisions of a risk-averse storage operator in the face of pre-dispatch forecast uncertainty, demonstrate that storage operator risk aversion can lead to reduced energy availability and/or curtailed discharge during periods of high prices. Such examples of withholding demonstrate that even during periods of relative scarcity, the full capabilities of an ESR may not always be available to the system.</p>
<h5 data-number="8.4.2.1.3" id="sec:info-context-esr-operation-information"><span class="header-section-number">8.4.2.1.3</span> What information is considered by the scheduler, and how</h5>
<p>All operational strategies heavily rely on information about the current and future states of the system and the market <span class="citation" data-cites="abdullaOptimalOperationEnergy2018">(<a href="#ref-abdullaOptimalOperationEnergy2018" role="doc-biblioref">Abdulla et al., 2018</a>)</span>.

Whilst storage operators predominantly rely on system and/or market forecasts to schedule their ESRs, there still exists a tension between information quantity and quality when considering <em>how</em> forecasts should be used in scheduling.</p>
<p>On one hand, operators can simultaneously consider multiple possible outcomes (forecast distributions or scenarios) by formulating scheduling as a stochastic or robust optimisation problem. Studies have used these methods to schedule ESRs in markets with a real-time platform <span class="citation" data-cites="yurdakulRiskAverseSelfSchedulingStorage2023">(<a href="#ref-yurdakulRiskAverseSelfSchedulingStorage2023" role="doc-biblioref">Ogun Yurdakul and Billimoria, 2023</a>)</span> or two (day-ahead and real-time) platforms <span class="citation" data-cites="wangOptimalSchedulingEnergy2017 krishnamurthyEnergyStorageArbitrage2018">(<a href="#ref-krishnamurthyEnergyStorageArbitrage2018" role="doc-biblioref">Krishnamurthy et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-wangOptimalSchedulingEnergy2017" role="doc-biblioref">Wang et al., 2017</a>)</span>, and to size and operate an ESR that can assist in system balancing given a historical distribution of VRE generation forecast errors <span class="citation" data-cites="bakerEnergyStorageSizing2017">(<a href="#ref-bakerEnergyStorageSizing2017" role="doc-biblioref">Baker et al., 2017</a>)</span>. However, beyond the difficulties that arise in characterising scenarios and distributions (e.g. assigning scenario probabilities or, as discussed by <span class="citation" data-cites="bakerEnergyStorageSizing2017">Baker et al. (<a href="#ref-bakerEnergyStorageSizing2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="yurdakulOnlineCompanionRiskAverse2023a">Ogün Yurdakul and Billimoria (<a href="#ref-yurdakulOnlineCompanionRiskAverse2023a" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span>, accounting for heavy-tailed forecast error distributions), robust methods can be overly conservative whilst stochastic methods require careful selection of risk metrics and, due to their computational complexity, may even prevent MPs from responding to new information in a timely fashion <span class="citation" data-cites="yangModellingOptimalEnergy2022 roaldPowerSystemsOptimization2023">(<a href="#ref-roaldPowerSystemsOptimization2023" role="doc-biblioref">Roald et al., 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-yangModellingOptimalEnergy2022" role="doc-biblioref">Yang et al., 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Given these issues, storage operators might instead prefer to implement optimal control strategies, such as model predictive control, that reschedule ESRs at regular intervals using the most recent (point) forecast information available. Scheduling decisions made using such approaches are often sensitive to the frequency of control decisions, the length of the control horizon lookahead, the operational characteristics of the ESR and the nature and accuracy of the forecasts used. Though previous studies have investigated the impact of a subset of these factors on ESR scheduling and market revenues, they synthesise forecasts by manipulating historical price time series <span class="citation" data-cites="sioshansiEstimatingValueElectricity2009 connollyPracticalOperationStrategies2011 dunbarImpactElectricityPrice2014">(<a href="#ref-connollyPracticalOperationStrategies2011" role="doc-biblioref">Connolly et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-dunbarImpactElectricityPrice2014" role="doc-biblioref">Dunbar et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-sioshansiEstimatingValueElectricity2009" role="doc-biblioref">Sioshansi et al., 2009</a>)</span> or by combining day-ahead and real-time prices <span class="citation" data-cites="mcphersonImpactsStorageDispatch2020">(<a href="#ref-mcphersonImpactsStorageDispatch2020" role="doc-biblioref">McPherson et al., 2020</a>)</span>. As such, the resulting forecasts may not adequately represent those that an MP might use to schedule an ESR in a short-term electricity market. Two earlier studies from the NEM use realistic forecast data and test the sensitivity of arbitrage revenues to pumped hydro energy storage durations <span class="citation" data-cites="mcconnellEstimatingValueElectricity2015 williamsBatteryNationOperation2019">(<a href="#ref-mcconnellEstimatingValueElectricity2015" role="doc-biblioref">McConnell et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-williamsBatteryNationOperation2019" role="doc-biblioref">Williams et al., 2019</a>)</span>, but only simulate operation on a half-hourly basis (rather than every dispatch interval or 5 minutes).

<p>Aside from what appears to be anomalous outcomes for some months in 2016 (one of which is likely related to the SA system black that year), Figure 23 shows that there were relatively few significant pre-dispatch price forecast errors (i.e. errors with magnitude <span class="math inline">\geq</span> 300 AUD/MW/hr)<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> in the NEM from 2012 to the end of 2017. However, price forecast errors have increased in frequency since 2018 in the day-ahead timeframe, and since 2019 for forecasts published up to 2 hours and 15 minutes ahead of delivery. The rise in price forecast errors consists not only of a greater number of negative price errors (red), which are an expected outcome of the pre-dispatch process (i.e. MPs increase resource availability in response to a high price forecast and subsequently depress the cleared price), but also positive errors, which appear to constitute a large portion of the errors occurring within 15 minutes of delivery. Positive errors this close to delivery are particularly concerning to MPs because they may lead to missed opportunities or, if MPs are scheduling ESR charging or have sold forward contracts that their resources are not positioned to defend, unexpected costs. There does not appear to be a clear link between the occurrence of a major system or market event and a greater number of errors – there were a large number of errors following a system black event in SA in 2016 and the explosion of a QLD coal unit in 2021, but lulls in errors also followed the retirement of a large VIC coal plant in 2017 and a double-separation event in 2018.</p>

<p>Flexible resources such as BESSs, hydro and VRE are able to adapt to changing conditions so long as their primary energy source is available and the market information relevant to their participation is published. To better ascertain whether flexible resources might also be affected by price forecast errors, we examine errors from the last available pre-dispatch price forecast (i.e. from the last P5MIN iteration, which is nominally run 5 minutes before delivery). Figure 24 shows that for NSW in 2021, there were some intervals in which the last available price forecast was different from the actual dispatch price by 10,000–15,000 AUD/MW/hr. Price forecast swings of this magnitude could have a significant impact on inflexible and flexible resource alike, and are possible with only small changes in supply or demand since resource offers and aggregate supply curves in the NEM typically resemble hockey-sticks <span class="citation" data-cites="hurlbutProtectingMarketHockey2004 energysynapseDemandResponseNational2020">(<a href="#ref-energysynapseDemandResponseNational2020" role="doc-biblioref">Energy Synapse, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-hurlbutProtectingMarketHockey2004" role="doc-biblioref">Hurlbut et al., 2004</a>)</span>. Factors that modify available supply, rather than demand, between the last 5MPD run and actual dispatch are likely to be responsible for these large swings as many of the significant price errors in Figure 24 occurred when demand forecast errors were close to zero. Because sudden outages are only occasional and AEMO regularly monitors pre-dispatch constraint accuracy to check if improvements to their formulation can be made <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorMonthlyConstraintReport2023">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorMonthlyConstraintReport2023" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2023e</a>)</span>, we conjecture that MP rebidding is a major contributing factor to the large price forecast swings in Figure 24. In the next section, we analyse trends in MP rebidding and propose a hypothesis that links rebidding activity to the rise in price forecast errors in the NEM.</p>

<p>Using data zipfile size as a proxy for the total number of bids, offers and rebids (which we will collectively refer to as <em>rebids</em> hereon for the sake of brevity), Figure 25 shows a gradual increase in the number of rebids beginning in 2018, which roughly coincides with the NEM’s first grid-scale BESS starting to participate in dispatch, followed by a more dramatic increase starting in 2021. Whilst 5MS-related changes likely contributed to the rise in rebidding in 2021, the number of rebids has continued to steadily increase as of the end of 2022. We surmise that this sustained rise in rebidding activity is a result of resources increasingly being commissioned with or adopting automated bidding systems (or <em>autobidders</em>) that can rapidly rebid <span class="citation" data-cites="mcardleRiseAutobidder2021">(<a href="#ref-mcardleRiseAutobidder2021" role="doc-biblioref">McArdle, 2021b</a>)</span>.</p>

The zipfile for each month consists of a single CSV with one AEMO data table (BIDPEROFFER) that contains quantity bid and offer data (including rebids). As such, zipfile size is a suitable proxy for the size of the underlying data and thus the number of bids, offers and rebids. Two 5MS-related changes were accompanied by spikes in bid and offer data zipfile size. The first is indicated by the blue dashed line, which denotes when MPs were able to start submitting the quantity component of their bids and offers for each 5-minute dispatch interval (rather than each 30 minute interval) for the next trading day. The second, denoted by the purple dashed line, denotes the commencement of 5MS.

</figure>
<p>To better understand which technologies are driving rebidding activity, we calculated the percentage of rebids from each technology type in June of every year from 2013 to 2021<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>. Figure 26 shows that rebids in June have grown considerably; there were ~1–3 million rebids in June in 2013–2018, but this increased to approximately 4.5 million rebids in 2020 and 46 million rebids in 2021. Though conventional resources (especially hydro) were still responsible for a large share of the increased rebidding activity in June 2021, BESS and wind resources overtook coal and gas-fired power station in the quantity of rebids submitted and BESS and VRE together accounted for approximately 35% of all rebids in June in 2021. This figure increases to just over 40% of all rebids if we include other newer market entrants such as demand response and virtual power plant aggregators. It is worth highlighting that BESS resources in particular are playing an outsized role in rebidding; over 80 wind farms and 60 open-cycle gas turbine units accounted for approximately 15% and 9% of all rebids in June 2021, respectively, compared to only 12 BESS plant accounting for ~13%<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Though we cannot make definitive conclusions, we surmise that the significant increase in the number of rebids and the greater role of newer market entrants in rebidding can be partially attributed to the growing use of autobidders in the NEM. Autobidders are typically integrated with BESS market participation control algorithms, and VRE resources are increasingly using them to manage the various complexities of market participation <span class="citation" data-cites="mcardleRiseAutobidder2021">(<a href="#ref-mcardleRiseAutobidder2021" role="doc-biblioref">McArdle, 2021b</a>)</span>. Furthermore, we propose that the rise in pre-dispatch price forecast errors, be they some time ahead of delivery or a sudden divergence close to real-time, could at least be partially explained by greater rebidding activity. MPs could be inducing large price forecast changes between pre-dispatch runs, or between pre-dispatch and dispatch itself (e.g. Figure 24), by regularly and rapidly shifting supply availability through rebids – a participation strategy that is enabled by resource flexibility and facilitated by the use of autobidders. In the next section, we shift focus from analysing pre-dispatch price forecast errors to assessing their impact on the arbitrage revenues of various BESS ESRs.</p>

<p>Through an optimisation modelling framework, we test the degree to which information quality affects the annual arbitrage revenues of 100 MW BESSs with different storage durations, scheduling optimisation objectives and scheduling lookaheads. We do so for the NSW market region, which provides an interesting case study given its relatively low price volatility historically (Figure 22) yet recent experience with sudden and significant price forecast swings (refer to <span class="citation" data-cites="prakashEnergyPriceConvergence2023">Prakash (<a href="#ref-prakashEnergyPriceConvergence2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023a</a>)</span> and Figure 24).</p>

<p>Two types of price data for the NSW market region from 2021 were used in this study:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Actual price data obtained using <code>NEMOSIS</code> to represent <em>perfect</em> price information <span class="citation" data-cites="gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018">(<a href="#ref-gormanNEMOSISNEMOpen2018" role="doc-biblioref">Gorman et al., 2018</a>)</span>; and</li>
<li>Price forecast data generated from processing 30MPD and 5MPD price forecasts obtained using <code>NEMSEER</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="prakashNEMSEERPythonPackage2023">(<a href="#ref-prakashNEMSEERPythonPackage2023" role="doc-biblioref">Prakash et al., 2023b</a>)</span> in three steps. Firstly, because 30MPD only produces forecasts with half-hourly resolution, 30MPD price forecasts were imputed using the next observation carried backwards (i.e. forecasted price at 13:30 is applied to intervals ending at 13:25, 13:20, …, 13:05). This reflects a typical interpretation of a 30MPD forecast. Secondly, because 30MPD is only run every half hour, the latest set of 30MPD forecasts were carried forward (i.e. set of forecasts generated at 13:30 are also used in intervals ending at 13:35, 13:40,…,13:55). Finally, the 30MPD forecasts for dispatch intervals within one hour of delivery were removed in favour of 5MPD price forecasts at 5-minute resolution. Together, these processing steps produced forecasts (or <em>imperfect information</em>) for each dispatch interval with 5-minute resolution up to 15 hours out from delivery<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>.</li>

<h5 data-number="8.5.2.1.2" id="schedules"><span class="header-section-number">8.5.2.1.2</span> Schedules</h5>
<p>Three year-long arbitrage schedules consisting of decisions to charge, discharge or idle were generated for each modelled BESS: one using a perfect foresight model, in which BESS operation is optimised across the entire year using actual price data in a single <em>step</em>, and two (one with actual and one with forecast price data) using a receding horizon optimal control (RHOC) simulation (Figure 27). The RHOC simulations consisted of <em>steps</em> every 5 minutes in which BESS operation is optimised for the duration of the lookahead horizon with actual or forecast price data, but only the action for the next dispatch interval is considered to be <em>binding</em> and is thus retained as a scheduling decision that affects the BESS’s state of charge. Successive steps were taken until a schedule for the entire year of 2021 was produced. Each step required optimising one of the mixed-integer linear program (MILP) formulations described in Section 6.5.2.1.3, all of which used a single binary variable for each interval in the forecast horizon to prevent the BESS from simultaneously charging and discharging in the same dispatch interval <span class="citation" data-cites="shafieeEconomicAssessmentPricemaker2016 wangOptimalSchedulingEnergy2017 yurdakulRiskAverseSelfSchedulingStorage2023">(<a href="#ref-shafieeEconomicAssessmentPricemaker2016" role="doc-biblioref">Shafiee et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-wangOptimalSchedulingEnergy2017" role="doc-biblioref">Wang et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-yurdakulRiskAverseSelfSchedulingStorage2023" role="doc-biblioref">Ogun Yurdakul and Billimoria, 2023</a>)</span>.</p>

<h5 data-number="8.5.2.1.4" id="sec:info-case_study-bess_simulations-method-assumptions"><span class="header-section-number">8.5.2.1.4</span> Assumptions and limitations</h5>
<p>Below, we outline the simplifying assumptions made by the study with regards to BESS dispatch and market participation. We discuss assumptions related to the BESS’s operating characteristics in Appendix 9.1.</p>
<ul>
<li>The BESS does not participate in FCAS or provide other system services. Modelling these would likely reduce the power and/or energy capacity available for arbitrage and also require the scheduler to consider FCAS price forecasts.</li>
<li>We optimise the BESS for dispatch decisions, but MPs would actually optimise their rebids. In theory, appropriately structuring a BESS’s price-quantity bands should mean that it only participates when it is commercially beneficial to do so whilst minimising or altogether avoiding losses in the event of sudden price forecast swings. In practice, many BESS across the NEM appear to be sacrificing some arbitrage upside by pursuing loss-averse bidding strategies. These entail a BESS bidding a large portion of its capacity into higher price bands to avoid being dispatched if low or moderate prices eventuate, and only rebidding this capacity into lower price bands when participation is perceived to be favourable (Figure 28). Though at least some BESSs no longer have this “all-or-nothing” approach to loss-averse bidding (compare 2021 and 2023 in Figure 28), there may be instances in which forecasts fail to predict a moderate-to-high price and a BESS only partially captures or even completely misses a significant revenue opportunity.</li>
<li>The scheduling decisions made by the 100MW BESS assume that it is a “small device”, i.e. a price-taker. Given the hockey-stick shape of the NEM’s aggregate supply curves, this assumption is likely to hold for lower prices. However, the BESS could play a role in shaping higher prices, e.g. shifting offered quantities to prevent prices from being depressed or to exercise market power. Doing so successfully would not only rely on accurate price forecasts, but also a good understanding of the BESS’s own market power.</li>
<li>The BESS maintains a dispatch target for the entire interval instead of ramping linearly between its last and next dispatch target – a requirement in the NEM <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperatorDispatchStandardOperating2019">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperatorDispatchStandardOperating2019" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2021d</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>BESS dispatch is not restricted by constraints in the NEM’s dispatch engine.</li>
<li>The market is settled for each dispatch interval, with the BESS being paid or charged the corresponding spot price for the NSW region. In reality, the regional spot price would be adjusted by the marginal loss factor of the BESS <span class="citation" data-cites="aemoTreatmentLossFactors2012">(<a href="#ref-aemoTreatmentLossFactors2012" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Operator, 2012b</a>)</span>.</li>

<p>Using pre-dispatch price forecasts can have a significant impact on BESS annual arbitrage revenues. Though a BESS scheduled with perfect information but a shorter lookahead horizon length of 1 hour can make some minor detrimental decisions (left plot in Figure 29), using price forecasts can lead to a BESS missing a larger number of revenue opportunities and sometimes incurring significant costs as a consequence of charging during an unanticipated price spike (right plot in Figure 29). Over the entire study year, using undiscounted price forecasts across the longest lookahead horizon reduced BESS arbitrage revenue potential by ~15–20% for a 4 hour BESS, ~40–43% for a 1 hour BESS and as much as ~62–64% for a 15 minute BESS (Figure 30).</p>

<p>Despite the magnitude of the aforementioned revenue reductions, our results also suggest that storage operators can reduce the impact of imperfect information to varying degrees by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Scheduling using longer lookahead horizons. As demonstrated by the reduction in the difference between VPF and VPI from a 5 minute to 15 hour lookahead for the 25 MW BESS, a long lookahead horizon is unsurprisingly important to longer duration storage. However, across most of the sensitivities tested in this study, our results suggest that most of this benefit can be captured with a lookahead horizon as short as 4 hours. This is because for undiscounted simulations, forecast quality accounts for most if not all of the lost revenue potential (i.e. <span class="math inline">VPF \approx VPI</span>) beyond 4 hours. Medium to longer-term operational planning is also important. Cycling constraints, such as those imposed by manufacturer warranties, may incentivise BESS operators to “preserve” cycles for the best opportunities (e.g. May to August in this study, which is, as Figure 31 shows, when the perfect foresight BESS was cycled the most).</p></li>
<li><p>Discounting price forecasts further into the future when scheduling BESS with sub-hourly storage durations. The exponential function slightly outperforms the hyperbolic function mostly likely due to the latter’s heavier discounting price forecasts closer to real-time, which tend to be more accurate (see Appendix 10). Using the discounting methods tested in this study leads to worse outcomes for the 4 hour BESS as longer-term arbitrage opportunities are devalued (e.g. a cost to charge now is evaluated against a discounted future revenue earned from discharging).</p></li>

<h2 data-number="8.6" id="sec:info-discussion"><span class="header-section-number">8.6</span> Options for improving scheduling</h2>
<p>The results from Section 6.5.2 suggest that the increasing frequency and severity of price forecast errors in the NEM’s pre-dispatch processes could be hampering their function as a scheduling coordination platform. In particular, flexible resources such as ESRs can lose significant fractions of their potential revenue to instances of sudden and extreme price divergence – products of the NEM’s fast real-time market, its lenient bidding rules, common MP bidding strategies and inelastic demand. In this section, we discuss options for MPs to mitigate the impact of imperfect information, and changes to centralised knowledge processes and market design that policy-makers could implement to improve resource scheduling outcomes.</p>
<p>MPs need not solely rely on centralised knowledge processes given that they can generate either their own point forecasts for use in deterministic scheduling methods, or forecasted distributions of prices (or price errors) for use in stochastic or robust scheduling methods (discussed in Section 6.4.2.1.3). However, in markets with blind auctions, producing private forecasts requires using historical data that likely reflect past market dynamics <span class="citation" data-cites="lagoForecastingDayaheadElectricity2021">(<a href="#ref-lagoForecastingDayaheadElectricity2021" role="doc-biblioref">Lago et al., 2021a</a>)</span>. In contrast, pre-dispatch is <em>mechanistic</em> – the best-available forward-looking information, which includes forecasted demand and constraints and the latest set of sealed bids and offers, is used in a modified copy of the market clearing engine <span class="citation" data-cites="trebbienUnderstandingElectricityPrices2023">(<a href="#ref-trebbienUnderstandingElectricityPrices2023" role="doc-biblioref">Trebbien et al., 2023</a>)</span>. MPs desiring a balanced solution would ideally use both private and pre-dispatch forecasts in their decision-making, as the former may be more robust to “noisy” market processes whilst the latter better reflects contemporaneous market dynamics and system constraints. Beyond improving price forecast accuracy, MPs should consider two scheduling changes that could improve market revenues. Firstly, scheduling algorithm modifications (e.g. as suggested in Section 6.5.2.2, longer lookaheads and the tested forecast discounting methods for ESRs with short storage durations) may deliver material improvements whilst being simple to implement. Secondly, rather than pursuing all-or-nothing (Section 6.5.2.1.4) or hockey-stick bidding strategies, MPs could appropriately structure their price-quantity bands to reflect costs and manage price risk. However, doing so would require MPs to partially divulge otherwise private information to the broader market and, for ESRs, could lead to increased cycling.</p>
<p>Though there are risks associated with “analytical monocultures” in which the “wisdom of the crowd” is replaced by shared beliefs and thus correlated actions <span class="citation" data-cites="bronkHayekWisdomPrices2013 bowlesRetrospectivesFriedrichHayek2017">(<a href="#ref-bowlesRetrospectivesFriedrichHayek2017" role="doc-biblioref">Bowles et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-bronkHayekWisdomPrices2013" role="doc-biblioref">Bronk, 2013</a>)</span>, improving the scheduling decision support offered by centralised knowledge processes may be necessary to address existing information and power asymmetries, and could become essential should policy-makers pursue two-sided or hierarchical market architectures that enable smaller consumer-owned energy resources to participate in real-time markets <span class="citation" data-cites="kristovTaleTwoVisions2016 hoganMarketDesignPractices2019">(<a href="#ref-hoganMarketDesignPractices2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hogan, 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-kristovTaleTwoVisions2016" role="doc-biblioref">Kristov et al., 2016</a>)</span>. One approach to improving decision support is to provide more information to MPs. This could not only involve publishing additional metrics (e.g. forecast uncertainty measures or the regional aggregate energy availability of energy-constrained resources) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionOperatingReserveMarket2023">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionOperatingReserveMarket2023" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2023c</a>)</span> but also implementing probabilistic or interactive pre-dispatch engines that provide MPs with a broader perspective of possible market outcomes than the pre-dispatch sensitivities discussed in Section 6.4.1.2. Notwithstanding the transparency benefits, the costs of increased information provision could exceed its benefits if it has little effect on MP decision-making due to greater complexity (e.g. if pre-dispatch deviates from the real-time market clearing algorithm) or the additional information is not immediately decision-relevant. It could even have deleterious effects should it provide information that reveals opportunities for gaming or collusion to MPs <span class="citation" data-cites="vonderfehrTransparencyElectricityMarkets2013 creativeenergyconsultingptyltdSchedulingAheadMarkets2020">(<a href="#ref-creativeenergyconsultingptyltdSchedulingAheadMarkets2020" role="doc-biblioref">Creative Energy Consulting Pty Ltd, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-vonderfehrTransparencyElectricityMarkets2013" role="doc-biblioref">Von Der Fehr, 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Another approach to improving the decision support offered by centralised knowledge processes is to promote schedule and price convergence. One low-regret option that might assist with convergence is increasing the frequency at which pre-dispatch and PASA are published. More frequent information provision may be particularly effective for a future NEM that will likely consist of many flexible resources that can rapidly respond to changing market conditions. However, this change’s feasibility is limited by the minimum solution times for these processes and, more importantly, it does not reduce the likelihood of sudden and extreme price forecast swings (Section 6.5.1). Addressing these swings may require restricting rebidding since the freedom to readily shift participation preferences frequently, dramatically and within seconds of delivery is enabling the use of all-or-nothing and hockey-stick bidding strategies that contribute to their occurrence. Policy-makers could consider rebid count/frequency restrictions or a “soft” gate closure, which would only allow rebids after a gate closure time close to delivery (e.g. 5 minutes ahead) if there are sudden changes in a resource’s technical status (e.g. forced outage). These sorts of rebidding restrictions might better incentivise MPs to submit a well-structured final rebid that not only reflects their costs and tolerance for price risk, but also hedges against changes from the time of the final rebid to delivery (e.g. demand errors, forced outages). This is also a low-regret option; even if it fails to elicit changes in bidding behaviour, restricted rebidding will at least improve transparency and reduce rebid volumes, thus assisting the market regulator with their assessment of rebid compliance.</p>
<p>Other options could prove to be more effective at improving ESR scheduling outcomes but are challenging to implement as they constitute drastic changes to market design and structure. Several of these options not only increase technical or decision-making complexity, but could also be politically infeasible as they are incongruous with norms in the NEM and the values enshrined in it its rules (e.g. minimising the confiscation of MP property rights) <span class="citation" data-cites="conejoRethinkingRestructuredElectricity2018">(<a href="#ref-conejoRethinkingRestructuredElectricity2018" role="doc-biblioref">Conejo and Sioshansi, 2018</a>)</span>:</p>

<h2 data-number="8.7" id="sec:info-conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">8.7</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>With growing deployments of flexible yet potentially energy-constrained VRE and ESRs and increasingly active demand-side resources, policy-makers worldwide are looking towards granular, faster and more flexible electricity markets to effectively and efficiently operate decarbonised power systems. However, achieving good operational outcomes is contingent upon scheduling coordination delivered through sound MP practices, appropriate market participation rules and purpose-fit knowledge process configurations.</p>
<p>Our work highlights that the increasing frequency and severity of price forecast errors in the NEM’s centralised knowledge processes can lead to sub-optimal scheduling outcomes for BESS ESRs (from ~15–20% reduction in potential annual arbitrage revenue for a 4 hour BESS to 60+% for a 15 minute BESS) and other scheduled resources that participate in the NEM’s real-time market. Whilst MPs can mitigate the impact of imperfect information by increasing scheduling lookaheads, modifying scheduling algorithms and/or producing robust price forecasts themselves, these changes alone cannot deliver centralised knowledge processes that guarantee “information adequacy” to a diverse range of MPs. This feature is particularly important for market designs and system architectures that aim to enable the participation of consumer-owned energy resources in electricity markets.</p>
<p>While some of the market design options we discussed may prove effective in improving resource scheduling outcomes, they predominantly consist of larger market design or structural changes that would be particularly challenging to implement in the NEM. Instead, we focus on how schedule and price convergence could be improved. One low-regret option is to increase the frequency at which centralised knowledge processes are run. However, just as continuous <em>trading</em> can overwhelm exchanges and induce an inefficient “arms race for speed” <span class="citation" data-cites="budishHighFrequencyTradingArms2015 silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022 ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022">(<a href="#ref-ahlqvistSurveyComparingCentralized2022" role="doc-biblioref">Ahlqvist et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-budishHighFrequencyTradingArms2015" role="doc-biblioref">Budish et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-silva-rodriguezShortTermWholesale2022" role="doc-biblioref">Silva-Rodriguez et al., 2022</a>)</span>, our analysis suggests that <em>bidding</em>, when continuous and unrestricted, may have deleterious impacts on system schedule convergence and thus system balancing. As such, we recommend that policy-makers in the NEM consider market participation restrictions that might better incentivise truthful or, at the very least, structured MP bidding strategies that are less likely to contribute to price forecast divergence and extreme and sudden price forecast swings. Furthermore, our analysis serves as a reminder to policy-makers elsewhere to exercise caution when making the short-term electricity markets in their jurisdictions faster and more flexible.</p>

<h1 data-number="9" id="sec:conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>Prompted by rising deployments of VRE, policy-makers are contemplating redesigning operational practices in their jurisdictions to more effectively and efficiently balance decarbonising power systems and electricity markets. Given the challenges and complexities of the design problem, achieving these outcomes is likely to require implementing flexible, “second-best” and context-specific solutions.</p>
<p>This thesis aims to address the following research question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Given existing design challenges and increasing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources as energy transition proceeds, how should we design operational practices for balancing electricity markets?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The broad scope of this research question was narrowed through three research objectives that were addressed through modelling and detailed empirical studies of facets of the Australian National Electricity Market. In this chapter, I first summarise the main findings of the research within this thesis according to the research objective they address. Specifically, Section 7.1 summarises insights from Chapter 4 that address Research Objective 1, Section 7.2 summarises the findings from Chapter 5 that address Research Objective 3, and Section 7.3 summarises the findings from Chapter 6 that address Research Objective 3. I then highlight potential opportunities for future work in Section 7.4. Finally, I provide brief closing remarks in Section 7.5.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.1" id="sec:conclusion-ro1"><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Research Objective 1</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To determine what features are needed in centrally-coordinated arrangements for procuring frequency control services during energy transition.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frequency control services are an important component of a system operator’s balancing toolkit and are critical to ensuring that imbalances are quickly addressed. The design of frequency control arrangements in restructured electricity industries will need to be revisited as resource mixes, network topologies and broader market arrangements and policy settings change with growing penetrations of variable renewable energy resources.</p>
<p>Based on the review of North American and European frequency control arrangements and the analysis of the NEM’s presented in Chapter 4, I offer four insights consisting of desirable features and design principles for policy-makers revisiting their jurisdiction’s frequency control arrangements during energy transition:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Control deficiencies may not be addressable through introducing new frequency control services. While this solution may address emerging needs, such as low-inertia operation, policy-makers need to better understand the interdependency, interoperability and interchangeability between frequency control services and the interactions with other technical attributes of the power system (e.g. system strength) to ensure that frequency control is first and foremost effective. Once this has been achieved, the short-run efficiency of arrangements can be improved through mechanisms such as dynamic and probabilistic dimensioning and co-optimising the procurement of interchangeable frequency control services.</p></li>
<li><p>A dynamically efficient outcome in some power systems may require additional investments in capability. Prices for frequency control services can be strengthened through scarcity pricing, which may better reflect the system’s preference for security and reliability. Such pricing mechanisms are complementary to appropriate and efficient cost-allocation based on causation or needs. Both efficient price formation and cost-allocation will improve the potential for frequency control services derivatives, which may assist in providing price signals for investment.</p></li>
<li><p>System operators should systematically and frequently verify frequency control service delivery, where relevant, and withhold or penalise remuneration when delivery is deemed to be insufficient. If such monitoring is in place, remuneration can be performance-based to drive the provision of high quality frequency control services. Performance monitoring would also enable the system operator to assess frequency control arrangements and identify any deficiencies in control action or procurement.</p></li>
<li><p>During energy transition, a suitable set of frequency control arrangements will most likely involve a combination of market-based and regulatory mechanisms. Frequency control is a power system public good and achieving frequency stability requires a degree of coordination and cooperation between resources. These characteristics make it difficult to establish complete markets for frequency control services, and an emphasis on market solutions may obscure these characteristics to market participants and undermine effective control. In contrast, regulatory mechanisms may prove to be more robust and resilient in the face of uncertainties, particularly those that are exogenous to the power system (e.g. climate risk). Regardless of whether arrangements are skewed towards market-based mechanisms or regulatory mechanisms, designers should be more forward-looking and avoid assumptions regarding the provision of frequency control capabilities over time, particularly when there is a pervasive competition norm and effective frequency control relies on sequential and hierarchical control actions.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="9.2" id="sec:conclusion-ro2"><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Research Objective 2</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To better understand how balancing flexibility capabilities in scheduling timeframes are changing during energy transition, and how these changes might impact the suitability and design of more decentralised operational balancing practices.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a role for empirical studies examining whether decentralised operational balancing practices, such as markets for services and products, are purpose-fit to deliver the balancing flexibility requirements of electricity markets in transition – particularly given that new markets for flexibility (e.g. reserve product markets) can introduce additional costs, constraints and complexity, and even encroach upon the functions of existing operational practices.</p>
<p>By quantifying the time-varying spectrum of balancing flexibility <em>capabilities</em> in scheduling timeframes for historical and projected resource mixes in two regions of the NEM in Chapter 5, I show that with higher penetrations of VRE: 1) downwards flexibility margins can be exhausted around noon if wind and solar are unable or unwilling to provide it, 2) upwards flexibility becomes more scarce during morning and evening peak demand events and 3) a greater portion of upwards flexibility is provided by energy-limited resources. Based on these findings and an assessment of various flexibility design options, I recommend that policy-makers examine how existing operational practices can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility provision, and that duration specifications and sustained footroom procurement be considered for reserve products.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.3" id="sec:conclusion-ro3"><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Research Objective 3</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To explore how more decentralised operational balancing practices can be configured to maximise the deployability of balancing flexibility in scheduling timeframes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solely examining <em>capabilities</em> is insufficient for determining the actual availability of balancing flexibility in electricity markets given that the latter is also shaped by market participation decisions. As such, I also examine some aspects of the <em>deployability</em> of balancing flexibility capabilities. In Chapter 6, I explore how market information, participation rules and participant operational strategies affect scheduling decisions and thus balancing flexibility provision from energy storage resources, which are widely touted to be critical to balancing decarbonised power systems. I first highlight the increasing frequency and severity of errors in AEMO-generated price forecasts, which are widely used by market participants in the NEM to schedule their resources, and propose a hypothesis that market participant (re)bidding is partially responsible for this phenomenon. I then model the extent to which BESS wholesale energy market arbitrage revenues might be reduced (compared to perfect foresight operation) should these forecasts guide battery energy storage scheduling. I find that revenue reductions can be significant, ranging from ~15–20% reduction in potential annual arbitrage revenue for a 4 hour BESS to 60+% for a 15 minute BESS. Based on the findings from these analyses, I discuss potential changes to market participant scheduling strategies and market design that could improve scheduling outcomes. I recommend that Australian policy-makers not only increase the frequency at which centralised knowledge processes are run, but also consider whether stricter market participation restrictions might incentivise participant bidding strategies that are less likely to induce sudden price forecast swings that can hamper effective scheduling.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.4" id="sec:conclusion-future_work"><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Future work</h2>
<p>The broad scope of the research question and the various limitations of the work within this thesis mean that there are multiple potential improvements and directions for future work. In the subsections below, I highlight the most significant of these improvements and directions.</p>
<h3 data-number="9.4.1" id="greater-consideration-of-demand-response-and-distributed-consumer-owned-energy-resources"><span class="header-section-number">9.4.1</span> Greater consideration of demand response and distributed, consumer-owned energy resources</h3>
<p>While Chapters 4, Section 5 and 6 discussed how demand response and distributed, consumer-owned energy resources have impacted or might impact operational practice design in the NEM to some extent, it is critical for future research is to gain a deeper understanding of how electricity markets can harness the numerous benefits presented by demand response and distributed, consumer-owned energy resources offering balancing flexibility to the system. The financial benefits of doing so in the NEM are estimated to be 1.0–6.3 billion AUD by 2030-2040 <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionUnlockingCERBenefits2023">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionUnlockingCERBenefits2023" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2023f</a>)</span>. There are three avenues for future work in this space that should be pursued:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Policy-makers must evaluate whether incremental adjustments to operational practices and market design offer material benefits. This involves not only advancing “enabling” reform, such as the flexible trading agreements <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionUnlockingCERBenefits2023">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionUnlockingCERBenefits2023" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2023f</a>)</span> and central dispatch visibility and integration mechanisms <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketcommissionIntegratingPriceresponsiveResources2023a">(<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketcommissionIntegratingPriceresponsiveResources2023a" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Market Commission, 2023g</a>)</span> being considered in the NEM, but also taking a holistic view when assessing seemingly unrelated reform pathways. An example of the latter is, as I discuss in Section 5.3, that technical or market participation requirements for reserve product markets may ultimately hinder balancing flexibility provision from smaller resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Policy-makers must develop a vision for a target future grid architecture. An important component of this second avenue is determining the extent to which arrangements should be “layered”; that is, whether new distribution system operator roles should be created and what these new entities should be responsible for <span class="citation" data-cites="energysecurityboardConsumerEnergyResources2024 kristovTaleTwoVisions2016 schittekatteDistributedEnergyResources2022">(<a href="#ref-energysecurityboardConsumerEnergyResources2024" role="doc-biblioref">Energy Security Board, 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-kristovTaleTwoVisions2016" role="doc-biblioref">Kristov et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-schittekatteDistributedEnergyResources2022" role="doc-biblioref">Schittekatte and Pototschnig, 2022</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Research on the needs, preferences and motivations of energy consumers should be continued as arrangements change. Existing work has already challenged the notion that financial incentives alone (e.g. residential and business tariffs) are sufficient to unlock flexibility from demand response and distributed, consumer-owned energy resources <span class="citation" data-cites="ransan-cooperApplyingResponsibleAlgorithm2021 adamsSocialLicenseAutomate2021 robertsSocialLicenseAutomate2023">(<a href="#ref-adamsSocialLicenseAutomate2021" role="doc-biblioref">Adams et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-ransan-cooperApplyingResponsibleAlgorithm2021" role="doc-biblioref">Ransan-Cooper et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-robertsSocialLicenseAutomate2023" role="doc-biblioref">Roberts et al., 2023</a>)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 data-number="9.4.2" id="interactions-with-investment-timeframes"><span class="header-section-number">9.4.2</span> Interactions with investment timeframes</h3>
<p>The design of practices and policies in operational timeframes should ideally consider those relevant in investment and planning timeframes as they are inextricably linked. For instance, as discussed in Section 5.3, resource adequacy policies implemented alongside the operation of short-term wholesale electricity markets (e.g. longer-term firming revenue or capacity contracts) may weaken the case for building investment signals into or altogether implementing new markets for flexibility.</p>
<p>Holistic design processes should not only work from the “top-down” (i.e. from investment and planning to operational timeframes), but also from the “bottom-up”.

<h3 data-number="9.4.3" id="empirical-studies-of-market-participant-behaviour"><span class="header-section-number">9.4.3</span> Empirical studies of market participant behaviour</h3>
<p>With a specific focus on market information, Chapter 6 discusses behavioural factors and market participant preferences that influence resource scheduling. However, while most of the studies reviewed in Section 6.4.2.1 and the storage scheduling simulations described in Section 6.5.2 <em>model</em> market participant behaviour, there is a need for more in-depth empirical research on market participant behaviour. Analysing market participant rebidding time series data could offer policy-makers with a clearer picture of how participants actually offer balancing flexibility to the system in their jurisdictions. The findings from these studies could be used to inform flexibility assessment modelling efforts (e.g. input bidding assumptions for market models). Moreover, such studies are important to understanding how market participants manage resources across a portfolio – a significant concern in jurisdictions such as the NEM that must contend with supply-side concentration and vertical re-integration (i.e. firms that operate a retail business whilst also owning generation assets) <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2022 simshauserLessonsAustraliaNational2019 chesterAustraliaNationalElectricity2024">(<a href="#ref-australianenergyregulatorStateEnergyMarket2022" role="doc-biblioref">Australian Energy Regulator, 2022a</a>; <a href="#ref-chesterAustraliaNationalElectricity2024" role="doc-biblioref">Chester, 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-simshauserLessonsAustraliaNational2019" role="doc-biblioref">Simshauser, 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<h3 data-number="9.4.4" id="modelling-the-network"><span class="header-section-number">9.4.4</span> Modelling the network</h3>
<p>The system models in Chapter 5 assumed that each modelled market region is a copper-plate network with no interconnection to other regions, and the BESS dispatch models in Chapter 6 assumed that BESS dispatch is not restricted by constraints in the NEM’s dispatch engine. As discussed in Chapter 5, transmission network constraints arising from thermal and stability limits are likely to reduce the balancing flexibility available to the system, whereas interconnection is likely to change the quantity and composition of balancing flexibility under certain conditions. Regardless, modelling both network constraints and interconnection will provide a more accurate picture of the extent to which balancing flexibility capabilities can be realised.</p>
<h2 data-number="9.5" id="sec:conclusion-closing_remarks"><span class="header-section-number">9.5</span> Closing remarks</h2>
<p>This thesis adopts an empirical, “second-best” and context-specific approach to addressing the question of how should we design operational practices for balancing electricity markets with growing penetrations of renewable energy.</p>
<p>Through a review of international frequency control arrangements and an empirical study of arrangements in the Australian NEM, I offer four insights consisting of desirable features and design principles to policy-makers revisiting the centrally-coordinated arrangements for procuring frequency control services in their jurisdictions during energy transition.</p>
<p>Then, following a quantification of the time-varying spectrum of balancing flexibility capabilities in scheduling timeframes for historical and projected resource mixes in two regions of the NEM, I propose that policy-makers examine how existing operational practices can be augmented to elicit upwards flexibility provision, and recommend that reserve products specify response durations and procure sustained footroom.</p>
<p>Finally, I explore how market information, participation rules and participant operational strategies affect the deployability of balancing flexibility from energy storage resources. Based on the findings from an analysis of AEMO-generated price forecasts commonly used for resource scheduling, I discuss potential changes to market participant scheduling strategies and market design that could improve scheduling outcomes. I recommend augmenting centralised knowledge processes and considering stricter market participation rules to discourage destabilising bidding strategies that may be hampering effective resource scheduling.</p>
<p>While there are several important avenues for future work, including greater consideration of demand response, consumer-owned energy resources and the interactions between operational practices and policies in the investment and planning timeframe, these findings will be valuable to policy-makers in the Australian National Electricity Market and other jurisdictions as their power systems progressively decarbonise. Furthermore, this thesis provides a framework for empirical, context-specific and “second-best” approaches to the design problem that is required for effective and efficient outcomes given the complexities and challenges involved in designing operational practices for electricity markets undergoing energy transition.</p>

<p>Run-of-river hydro generation and pumped hydro storage in NSW were aggregated and modelled as dispatchable generation with monthly energy constraints. These monthly energy constraints correspond to the average monthly inflows for the Snowy scheme (NSW and Australia’s largest hydro scheme) across financial years 2011 to 2018 (obtained from <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020">Australian Energy Market Operator (<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020b</a>)</span>). Though this model for hydro does not account for the additional generation that could be extracted from pumped storage, the application of monthly energy constraints could be interpreted as modelling one pattern of run-of-river hydro operation and/or enforcing the same reservoir level at the start and end of each month (and thus at the start and end of each year). Explicitly modelling reservoir schemes, inflows for individual hydro generators and pumping opportunities for pumped hydro storage are likely to improve the accuracy of the methodology proposed in this work for systems with significant shares of hydropower capacity.</p>

<p>For all scenarios for a given region, one set of four static price-quantity pairs were used to represent each resource’s offer in the market simulation.

<ul>
<li>For wind and solar PV generators, the entire available forecasted energy was offered at the market floor price to ensure preferential dispatch of VRE where possible.</li>
<li>For baseload conventional resources (coal-fired generation and Gas-Steam), the first band was priced at or close to the market floor price to ensure the resource’s MSL would clear the market. The second band was priced close to the short-run marginal cost (SRMC) of the resource. The SRMC was calculated using the average heat rate, fuel price and variable operating and maintenance cost of each resource type obtained from <span class="citation" data-cites="australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020">Australian Energy Market Operator (<a href="#ref-australianenergymarketoperator2020InputsAssumptions2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020b</a>)</span>.

<li>For peaking generation (OCGT and reciprocating engines), the first band was priced close to the SRMC of each resource, which was calculated in the same manner as for baseload conventional resources. The second and third band were offered at a moderate and higher premium relative to the resource’s SRMC, respectively. The fourth band was offered at the market cap price.</li>
<li>Hydro generation offers were adjusted iteratively to align the proportions of annual generation and average market prices of the NSW 2020 scenario with those calculated from historical data.</li>

<p>Equation <strong>¿eq:arb-1a?</strong> maximises arbitrage revenue over the scheduling lookahead horizon. Equation <strong>¿eq:arb-1c?</strong> and Equation <strong>¿eq:arb-1d?</strong> ensure that discharging and charging, respectively, are greater than or equal to 0 MW, and Equation <strong>¿eq:arb-1b?</strong> introduces binary charge state variables that are used in Equation <strong>¿eq:arb-1e?</strong> and Equation <strong>¿eq:arb-1f?</strong> to enforce the BESS maximum power capacity limit and prevent the BESS from simultaneously discharging and charging in the same dispatch interval. Equation <strong>¿eq:arb-1g?</strong> enforces BESS energy storage limits (the rationale for which we previously discussed in Section 9.1), and Equation <strong>¿eq:arb-1h?</strong> and Equation <strong>¿eq:arb-1i?</strong> are intertemporal constraints that model BESS state-of-charge evolution.</p>

<p>Equation <strong>¿eq:arb-3a?</strong> maximises arbitrage revenue over the scheduling lookahead horizon given discounted future prices (i.e. <span class="math inline">\lambda_t DF(r,t-t_0)</span>) and a penalty on the throughput accrued by the BESS over the optimisation window. The discount function <span class="math inline">DF</span> is either exponential or hyperbolic, and takes a discount rate <span class="math inline">r</span> and forecast ahead time <span class="math inline">t-t_0</span> as arguments. Refer to the next appendix (Section 10) for the discount function formulae, the methodology for determining discount rates and the discount rate values used in this study’s storage modelling. All other constraints are described in Section 9.3 and Section 9.4.</p>
<h1 data-number="12" id="sec:appendix-discounting"><span class="header-section-number">12</span> Methodology for discounting future price forecasts</h1>
<p>Delay discounting was used to model a scheduler’s belief that price forecasts will improve as the forecast run time approaches the forecasted delivery time. In other words, discounting price forecasts further into the future represents a time preference for <em>information</em>. The rationale for discounting price forecasts is that it can provide robustness to ESR operation by reducing the attractiveness of uncertain opportunities. However it is also problematic as “devaluing” revenues and costs in the near future (i.e. up to a day-ahead) is not reflective of the time periods over which a storage operator’s time preferences are stronger (i.e. over multiple months and years). Devaluing future revenues and costs could also lead to missed opportunities (e.g. due to discounted price spikes) and poor decisions (e.g. discounted lower prices that make charging more attractive than it otherwise would be).</p>
<p>Two discounting functions were tested: an exponential discounting function (Equation 13), which is commonly used in finance and neoclassical economics, and a hyperbolic discounting function (Equation 14), which has been used to model empirical evidence of intertemporal inconsistency in decision-making <span class="citation" data-cites="ainslieSpeciousRewardBehavioral1975 grune-yanoffModelsTemporalDiscounting2015">(<a href="#ref-ainslieSpeciousRewardBehavioral1975" role="doc-biblioref">Ainslie, 1975</a>; <a href="#ref-grune-yanoffModelsTemporalDiscounting2015" role="doc-biblioref">Grüne-Yanoff, 2015</a>)</span>. Instead of using the hyperbolic discount function to model the <em>choice</em> of a decision-maker, we use it to model a potential <em>belief</em> about information they might hold: that price forecasts further into the future are likely to be more-or-less equally “untrustworthy” (e.g. a forecast made 8 hours ahead might be as “inaccurate” as a forecast made 12 hours ahead).</p>
<p><span id="eq:exponential-discounting"><span class="math display">DF(r, t-t_0) = e^{-r(t-t_0)}\qquad{(13)}</span></span></p>
<p><span id="eq:hyperbolic-discounting"><span class="math display">DF(r, t-t_0) = \frac{1}{1+r(t-t_0)}\qquad{(14)}</span></span></p>
<p>Given their importance to market participants, counts of significant pre-dispatch price forecast errors (Figure 33) were used to calculate a discount rate for each function (i.e. <span class="math inline">r</span>, in units <span class="math inline">hr^{-1}</span>). Significant price forecast error price counts were max-scaled (i.e. counts at each ahead time were divided by the counts at 24 hours ahead) and then subtracted from one to produce the red curve in Figure 34. The exponential and hyperbolic discount functions were then fitted to this curve using curve fitting tools in the <code>scipy</code> package <span class="citation" data-cites="mckinney-proc-scipy-2010">(<a href="#ref-mckinney-proc-scipy-2010" role="doc-biblioref">McKinney, 2010</a>)</span>. The values of <span class="math inline">r</span> obtained from this process (outlined in Table <strong>¿tbl:discount-rates?</strong>) were then used alongside their corresponding discount functions in the arbitrage with discounting MILP formulation (Section 9.5).</p>

<p>Though the hyperbolic discount function obtains a better fit and reflects the intuition that forecasts say 15 hours out and 20 hours out are equally questionable, it discounts price forecasts closer to real-time (<span class="math inline">\lessapprox</span> 6 hours) to a greater degree than the exponential discount function (Figure 34). As we outline in Section 6.5.2.2, this may, in some cases, lead to poorer arbitrage performance than if an exponential discount function were used.</p>
